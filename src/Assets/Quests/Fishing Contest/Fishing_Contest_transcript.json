    "My, we are the persistent one aren't we? Well, there's a certain gold artefact we're after. We dwarves are big fans of gold! This artefact is the first prize at the Hemenster fishing competition. Fortunately we have acquired a pass to enter that competition... Unfortunately Dwarves don't make good fishermen.",
    "Okay, I entrust you with our competition pass. Don't forget to take some gold with you for the entrance fee.",

    "Well, when I were a young man we used to take fishing trips over to Catherby: The fishing over there \u2013 now that was something! Anyway, we decided to do a bit of fishing with our nets, I wasn't having the best of days turning up nothing but old boots and bits of seaweed. Then my net suddenly got really heavy! I pulled it up... To my amazement I'd caught this little chest thing! Even more amazing was when I opened it it contained a diamond the size of a radish! That's the best catch I've ever had!",
    "Ah... the Hemenster fishing competition... I know all about that... I won that four years straight! I'm too old for that lark now though...",
    "Well, you sometimes get these really big fish in the water just by the outflow pipes. I think they're some kind of carp... Try to get a spot round there. The best sort of bait for them is red vine worms. I used to get those from McGrubor's wood, north of here. Just dig around in the red vines up there but be careful of the guard dogs.",
    "Ahh well, I'm sure you'll find something to put him off. Afer all, there must be a kitchen around here with some garlic in it, perhaps in Seers Village or Ardougne. If e's pretending to be a vampyre then he can pretend to be scared of garlic!",
    "Why you young whippersnapper! If I was twenty years younger I\u2019d show you something that\u2019s for sure!",
    "Sigh\u2026 Young people \u2013 always in such a rush.",
    "Of course you can young man. Let\u2019s see now\u2026I think 5 gold is a fair price for a rod which has won the Fishing contest before eh?",
    "Right you are. I\u2019ll be here.",
    "Excellent choice!",
    "You\u2019re welcome young \u2018un.",
    "If you\u2019re sure\u2026 passing up an opportunity of a lifetime you are.",
    "Of course! Let me see now... You'll need a rod and bait. You can fish with a net too, but not in the competition.",
    "Then simply find yourself a fishing spot, either in the competition near here, or wherever you can \u2013 I recommend net fishing in Catherby. Net or Lure the fish in the fishing spot by clicking on it and then be patient...",
    "Yep! Go get em tiger."
