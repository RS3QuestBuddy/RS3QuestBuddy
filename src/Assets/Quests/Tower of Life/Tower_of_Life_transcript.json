    "You seem to like playing with danger, there.",

    "What?",
    "Wooden fingers?",
    "That's not possible, how could you move them?",
    "Yes, well I think I'd better be going now.",

    "How much?",

    "I prefer ordinary houses.",
    "Hi. Interesting building you have here. What's it for?",
    "I see some builders over there. So I assume it's not yet finished.",
    "So it's a tower.",
    "Yeah, they don't seem to be building much.",
    "Shame.",
    "Me?",
    "Sure, why not.",

    "Erm, do you?",
    "Ah, yes, it's now a small museum. Jorral's looking after it. He's really making history with that place.",
    "Ah, yes. Shame. Got to go. Bye.",
    "Best I go sort out this tower. Bye.",
    "Sorry, feeling a bit ill today.",
    "Are you Bonafido by any chance?",
    "Well, I've just spoken with Effigy about this tower. He tells me he hired you to work but you're on strike. Something about an extended tea break?",
    "Well, he wanted me to do something about it. Is there no way I can convince you to continue?",
    "Well, can I at least have a look inside the tower?",
    "I take offence at that! Give me a chance; you may be surprised.",
    "Count me in!",
    "Hi Bonafido.",
    "What clothes do I need?",
    "Say, that's a nice helmet.",
    "I was just wondering if you might be able to help me out with one?",

    "Five?",

    "Why, hello there!",
    "Clothing.",
    "Ah, come on. You know you want to give me free stuff.",
    "Yes, VERY busy I'm sure.",
    "Likely story. Sure you weren't skinny dipping?",
    "Hi, I'm looking to get some kit to look like one of you guys. Anything you might be able to help me out with?",
    "Hmmm. Has it been cleaned? I don't want some sweaty hand-me-down.",
    "Well, that sounds good. Can I have it then?",
    "Sure. What's your 'usual'?",
    "Simple, cheap beer. No problem.",
    "Hi, I'm looking to get some kit to look like one of you guys. You said you wanted a beer?",
    "What do you do when you're not lifting logs above your head?",
    "Yes.",
    "I can honestly say you're a very original guy.",
    "Hello. I was just wondering... I don't suppose you have any spare clothing you could lend me?",
    "Ah, thanks.",
    "Oh, but why? I could pay you!",
    "Hey, Bonafido.",
    "So... How do I look?",
    "Okay, what do you want me to build?",
    "Orange juice",
    "Tea",
    "Bottle of wine",
    "Why thank you. Do you think I have what it takes to become a famous whistler?",
    "Oh.",

    "Fetch a plaster and ointment.",
    "So what's left to build?",
    "Thanks!",
    "Hi again Bonafido.",
    "Not yet. I'll go when I'm ready. I'm taking my time, may have a quick cup of tea first.",
    "You winning?",
    "And now?",
    "Hi.",
    "Nope, not at all. I'd best be going. Have a nice day. Bye!",
    "I'm a builder!",
    "Well, I think it's a positive step in my career as a courageous adventurer.",
    "Hi. Sorry, but why do they call you 'Currency'?",
    "You must be pretty rich then.",
    "What happened?",
    "I'll bet! It pleases you, then, to know that I have just become a builder and have been granted permission to go mess around inside.",
    "Guess what!",
    "I'm a fully-fledged builder!",
    "I'm not sure about that, but I'll take a look and see what I can do.",
    "Wow, this place looks special. Best I look around for something to fix.",
    "Heya, Bona. I had a look at the building. There's some complex machinery in there! Going to cost someone.",
    "Well, I agree now they're up to something. The question is what...? I don't think we're going to find out much from the alchemists, though.",
    "I shall see if I can't fix it up and see for myself what is going on. Should be able to get a good reward from them. But don't worry, I'll make sure your efforts don't go unpaid.",
    "I must say, the inside of the tower is really something to behold.",
    "Hi, Currency. Got any spare cash?",
    "No, do you?",
    "I'm going to stop before this gets violent.",
    "I've fixed all the machinery.",
    "Now listen, what does it all do? Why are you-",
    "Wait! What about-",
    "Why does nobody listen? Best I follow them, I suppose.",
    "I'm really getting annoyed with those alchemists.",
    "Well, I completed the tower and I still have no idea what it does, and then as soon as I tell Effigy of my hard work, he doesn't say one word of thanks and legs it off into the tower!",
    "Don't worry, I'm not about to let Effigy get away with treating us builders like this!",
    "What on RuneScape is...",
    "They're insane!",
    "How is this possible?",
    "This is terrible, you must do something!",
    "I don't want a reward, just let it go. Can't you see it's in pain?",
    "Stop this! Let it go!",
    "It's getting angry.",
    "Not wise.",
    "They've run away. I must go confront those alchemists downstairs.",
    "That is one very sad creature.",
    "Why am I suddenly glad that you're not responsible for sorting out this mess?",
    "I can't believe what you guys have done.",
    "No. Scary!",
    "You won't BELIEVE what I just saw!",
    "That tower is...a tower of life! I just witnessed with my very own eyes the creation of a homunculus.",
    "Homunculus! They have found a way of creating life itself, but the creature they have made is not a happy being.",
    "Are you listening at all? This creature is very dangerous. It needs to be stopped. And fast!",
    "Effigy!",
    "I hope you learn from this.",
    "What?",
    "I'll just ignore that. So, what about that Homunculus up there? You can't just leave it.",
    "Why me? You created it!",
    "No.",
    "No way!",
    "Why do I get the feeling I'm doomed to go face that creature on my own?",
    "Oh well. My mum did always tell me that experience teaches fools.",
    "Hello?",
    "It's okay. I'm here to help you.",
    "No, honest. I helped the alchemists, but I had no idea what their plans involved.",
    "About what?",
    "Hmmm. A creature of logic and magic. Don't fear, I shall fix your mind!",
    "Watch me.",
    "You tell me that you're confused, so ask me some questions!",
    "I decided to root for [magic/logic].",
    "Okay.",
    "Sounds like a good plan. Can you get out of that cage?",
    "Okay.",
    "How are you?",
    "My pleasure.",
    "I'm not sure I understand, but okay, I will go have a word with them.",
    "Hi, Bonafido.",
    "Finished, really.",
    "Oh, I wouldn't worry about it. There are frequently new buildings required around RuneScape. I'm sure your services will be called upon again.",
    "The Homunculus is a bit better off now.",
    "Not just yet.",
    "Well, I've sat down and had a good chat with the Homunculus.",
    "You'll soon find out!",
    "Effigy, I need a word with you.",
    "Not quite...",
    "This place is bizarre!",
    "My pleasure. So what is this place?",
    "Oh dear, but you're okay now. You have this place to reside in.",
    "Hi there, you mentioned something about creating monsters...?",
    "Interesting. Tell me if I'm right. By the alchemists and builders creating you, you have inherited their combined knowledge in much the same way that a child might inherit the looks of their parents.",
    "So what do you need me to do?",
    "Okay. Sounds like a challenge."

    "Why, thanks.",
    "Always glad to help out a budding builder. But first, prove your Construction knowledge by answering some questions. How many nails does it take to make a rocking chair?",
    "One? How do you suppose to use a single nail?",
    "Nope. Keep guessing!",
    "Bingo! Okay, now what takes 3 planks, 3 cloths and 3 nails to make, and helps remove light from a room?",
    "Of cause, because that's what everyone needs - a rug up at their window.",
    "Those curtains are not going to be in any way opulent, matey.",
