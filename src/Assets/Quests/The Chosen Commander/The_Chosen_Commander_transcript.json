  "Captain Undak": [
    "Surface-dweller. Have a good day.",
    "Actually, yes. Tell me, surface-dweller: do you know how we Dorgeshuun raise our children?",
    "I am coming to that. Please indulge me. Children of the city are not raised by their natural parents. They are raised together in the city nursery. Every child has the same start in life. No one in Dorgesh-Kaan is rich or poor from birth. Their achievements in life are their own. I am captain of the guard not because of some family tradition, but because that is where my talent lay and that is what I chose.",
    "It is different from your way. I am not judging you; please do not judge us. I merely wished to impress onto you how important the nursery is. A whole future generation is raised together. If anything were to happen to them... I am sure you understand. Lately, some of the children have fallen ill. It could be nothing... but it could be another plot by the H.A.M. movement. I do not like asking for your help, surface-dweller, but this matter is more important than my pride. You have dealt with the H.A.M. movement before and may be able to help me. Will you accompany me to the nursery?",
    "The nursery is at the top of the nearby stairs.",
    "I do not have time to chat with the children today, Mernik.",
    "Some of the children have fallen ill. I suspect it is not simply an illness, but that they may have been poisoned by the H.A.M. group.",
    "Torzek. We're here to investigate.",
    "We suspect that the children have been poisoned.",
    "Quiet, child.",
    "Thank you, Torzek. That is what we were looking for. Surface-dweller, we should now question the children inside and outside the nursery. We need to find foods that were eaten by the sick children, but not by the healthy ones. I think we are looking for two foods in total.",
    "We need to work out which foods are poisoned.",
    "The nursery is the large building near to where we are standing.",
    "We should talk to all of the children and ask them what they ate. We need to talk to the healthy children as well as the sick ones. I think we are looking for two different food types. We need to identify two food types that were eaten by the sick children, but not by the healthy ones.",
    "Good. I hope you are right about which ones. Now, we should question the vendors who sold those foods. The food vendors have been buying 'exotic' spices from human merchants recently, to add extra flavours to their foods. The poison must have been in one of these special ingredients. We should ask the vendors which merchants they bought ingredients from. If the vendors of the poisoned foods both bought ingredients from the same human merchant, then we will have found our H.A.M. agent.",
    "This is no time for small talk, surface-dweller. We need to investigate the H.A.M. threat.",
    "I am not Zanik, surface-dweller. I am not some carefree youth on an adventure. I am here to do my duty and protect my city, not to enjoy myself! I know I am not well-liked. I am captain of the City Guard, the only Dorgeshuun who carry weapons in the city. The people of the city do not like weapons. But the City Guard is necessary - I am necessary - and so I discharge my duty to protect the city, no matter what the people, or you, think of me. We have spent enough time talking; let's get back to work.",
    "Are you sure? If you accuse incorrectly, you will have to pay 5,000 coins as compensation.",
    "Very well. Merchant, you are under arrest for the suspected poisoning of the city's food supply.",
    "Stop! Don't kill him! He's under arrest. Thank you both for your help. I must take this prisoner to stand trial before the council. Zanik, you should follow me and tell the council what happened to you while you were gone. Zanik... it is good to see you.",
    "No one said you could talk!",
    "Stay right there!",
    "Zanik! Guards, after her!",
    "[Player]. Zanik has got away from us. Will you help us find her?",
    "I have the guards searching the city, but Zanik may have escaped into the caves to the south. No one knows those caves better than she does.",
    "Zanik knows the city and the caves better than anyone. She could run rings around my guards, but you're an adventurer like her, so you stand a chance of finding her. Plus, she trusts you. I think you're the only person she really trusts. You could convince her to give herself up.",
    "She'll have to stand before the council. If it was me, I'd be lenient, but they'll have to do something.",
    "I'm not asking you to betray her. She's not thinking straight, but that doesn't mean you can't. Where will she go? The north gate is small and guarded so she can't escape to the surface. She could hide in the city or in the south caves. Sooner or later we'll find her, but there would be a confrontation. It would be better for everyone if you could talk to her and convince her to come back.",
    "Zanik killed a prisoner who was in my custody. She went against the agreed, democratic decision of the council. You surface-dwellers may mete our vigilante justice, but that's not how we do things here.",
    "Thank you. I think she is somewhere in the caves to the south of the city. No one wants either of you to be hurt, though, so please be careful.",
    "[Player]. Thank you for your help in bringing Zanik in. I have another task for you if you're interested.",
    "In all the excitement surrounding Zanik, people seem to have forgotten that someone tried to poison us. WE need to know whether he was working alone or whether he was part of an organised plot. I would like you to infiltrate the H.A.M. base near Lumbridge and find out what Sigmund is planning now.",
    "Thank you. You will need to talk to people in the H.A.M. base until you get to the bottom of their plans. Here is a set of H.A.M. robes we have acquired. You may find them useful.",
    "This task specifically requires a surface-dweller. Are you interested?",
    "Zanik, [Player]. Thank you for coming back. The situation here is grave.",
    "The portal that you returned through has appeared again. Someone else came through wearing a huge suit of glowing armour.",
    "There was a goblin inside, but it seemed like the armour was moving him rather than the other way around. It paced up and down the city. Some of the guards tried to stop it, but it just swatted them aside with a huge rock it was carrying. It planted the rock here, then went back to its portal and disappeared.",
    "Three guards were killed; five more have broken bones and are being seen to. The guards couldn't even slow it down. It could have killed everyone in the city if it had wanted to. I don't know how we can defend ourselves if it comes back.",
    "I don't know. The scribe has been translating it. I think he's nearly ready now; the council is assembling to discuss it.",
    "For now, all I can do is keep order. The council is discussing the emergency, but I don't know what they will decide. I don't envy them.",
    "The council is assembling. You and Zanik should go to the council chamber. They will want to hear anything you know about this.",
    "You should go to the council chamber.",
    "There you are! I've looked all over the city. Zanik. [Player]. It is good to see you well. Everyone is waiting for you. Ur-tag wants to make a speech.",
    "There you are! I've looked all over the city. Zanik. [Player]. It is good to see you well. Everyone is waiting for you. Ur-tag wants to make a speech."

    "I'm back! Did you miss me?",
    "You thought I was dead? But I was only gone for a few minutes!",
    "Thanks, [Player]. Wait \u2013 how long was I gone for?",
    "Months! But... I must have been unconscious for all that time. I'd better tell you what happened.",
    "After I was pulled into that box on Yu'biusk, I lost consciousness. It only seemed like a few minutes, but I must have lost months. I woke up in this huge room. From the smell of the air I was still in Yu'biusk. It was cold and very still... I managed to climb onto the goblin statue and balance on its head. I found I could jump between the statues' heads! That proved to be the key to getting out of there... From the top of this statue I could see into the bowl. It was clearly magical \u2013 some sort of scrying bowl.",
    "That was my house! Why would the scrying pool be focused there? Woah... Hey! Can anyone hear me?",
    "You can hear me! Listen, I'm trapped in Yu'biusk, but I'm alive! Please tell the council, and get a message to [Player]...",
    "I found my crossbow! There were no enemies around, but I could use the crossbow with a grappling hook to get to places. I grappled on to the huge statue and swung across to the throne. The pendant was... powerful \u2013 I could feel it even before I touched it. It was the same feeling I had when I drank the Tears of Guthix for the first time, and when you brought me back to life, and when we opened the box... I was that same feeling, but even more intense. I put it on.",
    "...and when I emerged from the portal I saw you fighting that H.A.M. agent, so naturally I joined in! I suppose we should go and talk to the council. They'll want to know what happened to me.",
    "Well, you know... It'll just be a long boring meeting where the politicians talk and talk and talk.",
    "They normally make the right decision. It just takes them such a long time. Sometimes they'll disagree with one another and spend months arguing back and forth. Even when they do basically agree, they'll still spend months arguing over the tiny details.",
    "I don't know. Maybe if it was like the surface, where you have dukes and kings. One person in charge by birthright...",
    "I...I'm not sure. I don't really think anyone has a right to rule from birth. I don't know what came over me. Let's just get the council meeting over with. Come on, [Player].",
    "Yeah, you're right. Of course you are. I don't know what I was thinking. Let's just get this council meeting over with, [Player].",
    "I will, but I want to tell you first.",
    "Oh! Okay then. I'd better tell you what happened.",
    "I'm fine. I'll tell you what happened later. Right now we should deal with the H.A.M. agent.",
    "Just like old times, [Player].",
    "Don't be so modest, [Player]. We did it together.",
    "You're not going to execute him?",
    "It's not right, [Player]! He needs to pay for what he did!",
    "This is pointless! This man tried to poison the children! He deserves to die!",
    "What happened, [Player]?",
    "I just... I don't know what came over me.",
    "I was so angry. I mean, he was trying to kill the children! All I could think of was that he was trying to kill the children and he deserved to die, and the council wouldn't do it.",
    "You don't really think that, [Player]. In the meeting, you said that they should hand him over. Did he really deserve to die?",
    "I should have listened to you in the meeting, [Player]. I... wish I hadn't done it.",
    "I...I know you tried to kill him too...but I'm not sure. I don't know whether it was the right thing to do. I...I wish I hadn't done it.",
    "That was on the battlefield. It was them or me. This time, he had already been captured. He was helpless. It's totally different. I wish I hadn't done it.",
    "No. I'm glad he's dead.",
    "No. The council isn't like that. I wouldn't want...they shouldn't have to do something like that. It isn't right.",
    "No. I know you've helped us before, but I don't want you to do all our dirty work for us.",
    "I don't know. I wish... I wish none of this had happened. I wish there weren't any people who wanted to kill us. I wish we lived in a world where everyone could be happy and not fight one another.",
    "Yeah, maybe. It's just hard to stay positive sometimes. *sigh* Alright, [Player]. I'm ready. Let's go back to the council.",
    "There wouldn't be a place for you and me without conflict, huh? *sigh* Alright, [Player]. I'm ready. Let's go back to the council.",
    "I don't know what happened. I was overtaken by emotion. I know that's not an excuse. I'll accept whatever sentence you decide on.",
    "Please don't, [Player].",
    "So... I suppose this is goodbye, [Player].",
    "No, [Player]. I think I need to be on my own for a while... get things sorted in my head... think about my destiny. I'm sure I'll see you again... someday.",
    "I'm not sure. I might go to live with the surface goblins or I might just wander around looking for adventures.",
    "Oh, I'll be fine. I've visited the surface on my own a few times since I went there with you. I can take care of myself.",
    "Goblins, attack! Kill all humans! [Player]? Quick, [Player]! Sigmund's getting away! Stop him!",
    "Not this time, Sigmund. No ring of life. No last minute escape. No more treating this like it's a game!",
    "Begging didn't get me anywhere when I was in your power. Remember? I'm going to enjoy returning the favour.",
    "Shut up, [Player]! You're next!",
    "Shut up, [Player]! You're next!",
    "Shut up, [Player]! You're next!",
    "You're stronger than I thought, human.",
    "No one can kill me! I am the Chosen Commander of the Big High War God. His power protects me.",
    "No one can kill me! I am the Chosen Commander of the Big High War God. His power protects me.",
    "Give up, human. No one can interfere with my destiny.",
    "Never let it be said that the Big High War God is not merciful. I will make your death swift.",
    "Actually, I can!",
    "This is what my whole life has led up to. I am the Chosen Commander of Bandos!",
    "I have seen the light of the Big High War God. His power flows through me.",
    "We shall see.",
    "But now I see my destiny. I am the Chosen Commander!",
    "Our friendship? You are an enemy of the Big High War God!",
    "You... you were always a good friend, [Player]. I don't want to hurt you. B-but I must! The Big High War God commands it!",
    "Before I saw the light. Before I went to Yu'biusk. Now, I see my destiny. I am the Chosen Commander!",
    "Your trust was useful, but now it will be your downfall.",
    "Why won't you just die, human?",
    "No one is stronger than me. I cannot be defeated!",
    "The Big High War God commands... [Player], I...I'm trying to fight, but it's too strong! I don't want to hurt you. I'm sorry! She is mine, human! She can never break free of my power!",
    "Your cowardly pleas do not move me, human. All the world will plead and I will show no mercy.",
    "Zanik is mine, human. I branded my symbol into her forehead. I raised her from the dead. I guided her to Yu'biusk and gave her my pendant of leadership. She belongs to ME!",
    "I am War! I am Power! I am Bandos, the rightful god of all goblins, and through this puppet commander, I shall become god of all Gielinor!",
    "You dare command me? I am Bandos, the Big High War God! You are as an insect to me. Soon all will worship me or be destroyed.",
    "I... I can't, [Player]. It's too strong!",
    "[Player], I... I'll try. If you think I can do it...",
    "I... I can't let that happen. You're right, [Player]! I've got to...",
    "You... you're right! I've been a... a puppet, all this time, but I won't go on like that. I can do it!",
    "The cave's collapsing! Quickly, [Player], take my hand!",
    "Where are we? We should be in Dorgesh-Kaan, but it's dark.",
    "Two people using the same sphere must have made it malfunction. I'm sure we're somewhere close to the city, though...",
    "Earthquake!",
    "[Player]! You're alright!",
    "I'm not hurt, but I'm trapped on the edge of a chasm! I can't move!",
    "It felt like an earthquake, but I'm not sure. It can't be a coincidence that it happened just then.",
    "[Player]! Thank goodness you're alright! I'm trapped. I can't see any way across.",
    "[Player]! Don't leave! The cave is unstable!",
    "No. I used my last one.",
    "Are you mad? Do you think I can stick to walls like a molanisk? I'd fall to my death!",
    "I can't see any place where the grapple would catch.",
    "Okay. I'll try, but you'll have to direct me.",
    "I'm sorry, [Player].",
    "All right, [Player]. I'll try.",
    "I... I can't do it, [Player]. You should leave me here.",
    "Alright. One more try...",
    "Talk about what?",
    "[Player], I'm sorry. I was... I was under the control of the pendant. I feel terrible. Please don't make this any harder than it is.",
    "Thank you [Player]. That... that means a lot to me.",
    "As soon as I took the pendant off I could feel the presence gone. I'm sure it was the pendant, and now that it's gone, I'm free.",
    "I...I don't know what I can say. I hope I can prove myself to you again.",
    "It's hard to describe. It was so subtle at first. My opinions started changing, but they still felt like they were my opinions. When I was fighting you... you made me think about what I was doing. You made me realise that I wasn't myself. Then it was like another presence was in my body and I was fighting to control it. It was horrible.",
    "It was the Big High War God, Bandos...or at least, that's what it claimed to be. I could feel its mind. It was so...callous. It just doesn't care about us: not goblins, not humans, not anyone. It doesn't see us as people, just things to own and control.",
    "I'm shaken, but I think I'll be alright. I won't let that happen to me again.",
    "After I left Dorgesh-Kaan, I went to the goblin temple at the Plain of Mud. They welcomed me! Maybe they'd forgotten what I said last time I was there, when they locked me up. They were talking about some H.A.M. people who'd attacked goblins nearby, and about a base they'd heard had been set up nearby. I started saying that maybe they should organise themselves and fight back...and then the next thing I knew, I was on the preacher's podium telling them all to form an army to destroy the H.A.M. base! I think that's when the pendant started to really take over. I was saying things I didn't really think, that all humans must die. Horrible things...but they seemed so right at the time. I suppose all those goblins are dead now, killed in the fight or when the cave collapsed...and it's my fault. They were all so brave, prepared to fight to the death, whatever happened. Misguided, maybe, but very brave.",
    "Thanks, [Player]. I had nearly given up... but I'm feeling better now. We'd better not try to teleport again. Dorgesh-Kaan should be within walking distance. Now let's go! We need to get to Dorgesh-Kaan to deal with the High Priest!",
    "Juna! It's so good to see you! I was trapped in Yu'biusk, but now I'm back, an-",
    "I know! We've got to stop that High Priest!",
    "Return? Bandos is evil! He just wants us to serve him and fight in his wars!",
    "Just because it's my destiny it doesn't mean I have to do it!",
    "I'll take my chances. Let's go, [Player].",
    "What's the matter? What's happening in the city?",
    "Kazgar, you've got to let us in. Maybe we can help.",
    "Thanks, [Player]. Now, let's see what's happening in the city.",
    "What happened?",
    "Someone else? You mean the goblin High Priest?",
    "We have.",
    "[Player], please! This is more important.",
    "We can fight.",
    "We can fight! I've had that... thing inside my head. It's not merciful. It doesn't see us as people. It only wants to dominate, to control. Our ancestors defied it. They escaped its clutches, they broke all of its hateful commandments, they built a new city \u2013 a new world \u2013 where we could be free. We haven't gotten rid of conflict or suffering entirely \u2013 maybe we could have, given more time and effort \u2013 though we have done pretty well. Our whole history since then, every one of us who has lived and loved and built and dreamed, has been one glorious act of defiance. If we surrender, that rebellion will be undone. Bandos won't just make us suffer, he won't just reduce us to barbarism \u2013 he'll turn us into an instrument of evil. But if we fight it now, then even if we die, that will be the crowning of our defiance. I thought I couldn't fight, but [Player] told me that... that [he/she] believed in me. That's what we need now; to believe in one another. You say that we can't win, that we can't fight. Well, perhaps you're half right; perhaps we can't win. But we can fight.",
    "So, [Player], I suppose this is it. This is the end. I'm... I'm glad you're here. I should go and get ready now. The scribe seemed very worried... I mean, even more than you'd expect. Maybe you should go back into the council chamber and see if you can help him. I'll be near the portal if you want to talk to me.",
    "Hello, [Player].",
    "Oldak told me about his idea. I'm not that hopeful, though.",
    "Thanks for trying, [Player], but I know that's not true. I know Oldak; he's never absolutely certain about anything. Thanks, [Player], I don't think we're quite ready to go yet. Perhaps you could go and check up on Mernik in the nursery. I'm worried about how the children are taking all this.",
    "I suppose you're right. Oldak's gadgets normally work... but this isn't a normal situation. Thanks, [Player]. I don't think we're quite ready to go yet. Perhaps you could go and check up on Mernik in the nursery. I'm worried about how the children are taking all this.",
    "I'm just...I just want to take a moment to get ready. I guess I'm saying goodbye to the city.",
    "I was born here - I grew up here - but I've never really... It's always seemed too small for me. You know, just a few years ago, I thought the city was the whole world, that there was just solid rock outside, going on forever. As soon as I found out that the surface existed, I wanted to see it. And thanks to you, I did see it. The time when I first saw the sky... it was so beautiful. It made the city seem smaller than ever. But now... It's like what you said about a perfect world. Your people and mine could have built something wonderful together, but that's just a hopeless dream now.",
    "No, [Player]. We can't beat this enemy. We can't run and we can't surrender. The only thing we can do is go down fighting... and that's what I intend to do. You might get away - Bandos won't try to chase you - but this is the end for Dorgesh-Kaan, and for me.",
    "Thank you. I meant it. And I think... I think every cave goblin, deep down, thinks the same thing. It was what the H.A.M. agent said, wasn't it, that he'd rather die than submit? Sigmund, too, just before... It would be better to die than submit to such an evil power. We can run and hide or we can fight, but even if there's no hope, we can't surrender. Better to die.",
    "Thanks, [Player].",
    "Well, I'm ready. You should prepare for the fight.",
    "Alright, [Player]. Let's go.",
    "No surrender.",
    "We have no gods! We don't need you any more! And if you still need us, then I guess that makes us stronger than you!",
    "All that just to get people to worship you? You're pathetic!",
    "My crossbow! [Player], quick, pick up the pieces!",
    "So did I. I really thought I'd die here, but it looks like I was wrong about that. Is it over [Player]? Did we beat him?",
    "I... *cough*... I think I'll live. Is it over, [Player]? Did we beat him?",
    "I didn't think we could do it. It looks like Bandos wasn't as powerful as we thought. Hand me the pendant; it's time to end this.",
    "Please, [Player]. I'm not going to wear it; I'm going to destroy it.",
    "I'm bruised all over and I think I've got some broken ribs...but I've never felt better.",
    "It is? That's good. That means... that means I'm not under his power any more. I'm not under anyone's power. I have no destiny... I'm free!",
    "There, it's over. Let's go, [Player].",
    "You know, I didn't think it would. It looks like Bandos wasn't as powerful as we thought. Hand me the pendant; it's time to end this.",
    "Haha! I knew you could...*cough*...cope, so I had a little nap. Hand me the pendant; it's time to end this.",
    "There's a way we can make sure. Hand me the pendant; it's time to end this.",
    "I hope I didn't...*cough*...miss anything. Is it over, [Player]? Did we beat him?",
    "No, really, I'm fine! I still ache a bit but I'll heal up.",
    "No, I... [Player], I want you to have it. You fired the shot that finished off the Bandos avatar. It should be yours.",
    "No, I insist. I can get a new one for myself.",
    "A speech?",
    "Is that why... Well, anyway, it's yours.",
    "A speech?",
    "Look, [Player]! They made a statue of us!"

  "Ur-taal": [
    "Zanik!",
    "Zanik! It's good to see you! Captain Undak told us you were back.",

    "I have Duke Horacio's assurance that any H.A.M. agents caught attacking the city will be dealt with.",
    "Execute him?",
    "Zanik, Dorgesh-kaan does not practice the death penalty. Even if we did not have to hand him over, we would have to imprison him here.",

    "Zanik's character has been taken into account. We believe she had good intentions. Nevertheless, we must take action.",
    "However much you disagree with our laws, Zanik had broken them, and there must be consequences.",
    "Very well. Zanik, your achievements have already earned you a place in this city's history books. You have been our first explorer, our protector, and the favourite daughter of Dorgesh-Kaan. You have, however, broken our laws and risked a diplomatic incident with the surface people. The council is not above the law; justice must be done. It is the decision of this council that you be banished from the city, not to return until the council sees fit. Oldak will supply you with a moving-over-distance sphere. We will give you a few minutes to say your goodbyes.",
    "Zanik, [Player], thank you for coming. I trust you have seen the obelisk?",
    "Our scribe has just finished translating the inscriptions. It makes for chilling reading.",
    "That is the situation. Our worst fears have been realised. Unless you can help us, it seems that our city is doomed.",

    "Order! There is no point in discussing what might have been.",
    "What?",
    "Then we fight. Captain Undak, Zanik, you will prepare our defences. [Player], I know that this is not your fight, and I would not blame you for leaving us now, but if you wish to stay, you should ask around the city for anything you can do.",
    "No one could have predicted this!",

    "Yes, perhaps you're right. None of this would have happened.",
    "It's not your job to know, it is mine, and I still don't.",
    "This wasn't the first time we had contact with the surface. Did you know that? Passages had opened before - earthquakes, mining accidents - but we always sealed them again.",
    "The difference this time was that you came down to investigate. We couldn't hide any more, but we could still have kept surface-dwellers out of the city.",
    "The council had meeting after meeting about it. We couldn't reach a consensus, so we had to vote, and the council was evenly split. I had the deciding vote... It was the hardest decision of my life.",

    "Zanik doesn't share your confidence. She thinks the best we can do is go down fighting. I don't know if she's right, but I can see why she thinks that.",
    "We're going up against a god here, [player]. The same god our ancestors fled from, or at least, some avatar or agent of that god. In our mythology, the War God is a figure of absolute, unstoppable evil.",
    "Whatever plan you come up with, I dont[sic] think any cave goblin really believes we can win.",
    "I don't think you can help me. You should go down into the city and talk to people. You're a hero - seeing you're here will give people hope.",
    "People of Dorgesh-Kaan, this is the start of a new era.",
    "This city was founded in fear. The gods were destroying the surface world with their wars, and our ancestors survived by hiding and cutting themselves off.",
    "Since then, fear has been our guiding principle. The movements of the earth have opened passages to the surface, but we have always closed them, not even looking out to see whether the surface was safe.",
    "But we could not hide forever. One surface-dweller, [Player], displayed a trait we had forgotten: curiosity.",

If we combine Grubfoot's magic with our technology, I think we can disrupt his ability to regenerate.

Turgall should have some spares if you ask him \u2013 bring them to me near the portal to the throne room.",

    "Ah, excellent. Now, I'll attach them to Zanik's crossbow... There. I've given the crossbow a new special attack \u2013 when the Bandos avatar starts to regenerate, Zanik should use it. I think that will interfere with the avatar's regeneration. I won't lie to you: this is an untested theory. It might not work at all, but it's worth a shot. Zanik is by the portal, you should give her the crossbow.",
    "What? Oh, yes. First, I'm assuming that this Bandos avatar is powered by magic. Secondly, I'm assuming it's the same kind of magic that Grubfoot uses. That means I know how to disrupt it. I'm also assuming that the avatar will be vulnerable for a short time, just before it regenerates. If you can disrupt its magic at that point, its grip on the possessed body could be broken.",
    "Yes, you're right. Under normal circumstances I'd never try an idea I was this unsure of, but I don't have time to do proper research now, so I have to go by my best guess.",

At the end of the Great War, the evil Guthix banished me from Gielinor and I could no longer command my armies. No mortal could have done this to me, only a god. But I was determined to thwart him. The goblins and orks and ogres of this world are rightfully mine and I would not give them up! Without me to lead them, the goblins nearly wiped themselves out, so I sent a vision to stop them, and I told them to wait for my Chosen Commander. Later, when the Dorgeshuun tribe broke back through to the surface, I saw my chance. I used the Tears of Guthix to make Zanik my Chosen Commander. I even raised her from the dead! Her life belongs to me! I led you along with visions and hints about your destiny until you opened a portal to my realm. Then I brought Zanik to my throne room where she could take my pendant of command. Any goblin that wears the pendant comes under my control. I was going to use Zanik to command all my armies, but this priest will do just as well. Once again I will be in direct command of the goblins and all my other races! I will set them against the other races and turn the whole of Gielinor into a monument to my glory!",
