  "Burntmeat": [
    "Oh, it you again. I bin thinking 'bout you.",
    "Well, Burntmeat need big important job doing, and you bin helpful before. You fetch Burntmeat tasty human for stew that time.",
    "Aww, now you done hurt Burntmeat's feelings.",
    "You remember you come in here asking me questions about goutweed, yah?",
    "Yah. But Burntmeat is hearing where goutweed is growing again.",
    "Well, I was cooking dis adventurer...",
    "Nah, silly red metal just hurt troll teeth.",
    "Huh? What dis? You got goutweed here!",
    "Only place find goutweed is my storeroom. You bin stealing?",
    "What say? Goutweed not grow now. Trolls pick it all.",
    "Humans grow goutweed? You lying to Burntmeat!",
    "Mmmm. Burntmeat think that sound good. But Burntmeat cook you first.",
    "Well, he give me mighty sore tummy later. I think I forget to wash his feet.",
    "Ah! Der man I cooked, he say humans growing goutweed again. Now, if humans growing goutweed, maybe trolls can grow goutweed too, yah?",
    "No, not me. Burntmeat stick to what he best at doing. But I got me an assistant wanting to learn farming. He called My Arm.",
    "He called My Arm.",
    "My Arm.",
    "It a perfectly good troll name.",
    "You gonna help My Arm grow goutweed.",
    "See, Player, if My Arm learns to grow goutweed, I get as much goutweed as I ever want. If dat happens, I promise you I never cook another human in my life.",
    "Never. Burntmeat promises. Goat taste just as good as human if you add enough goutweed. Now you go talk to My Arm; he tell you what to do.",
    "What dragon stuff you talking 'bout?",
    "Sorry, Player - Burntmeat chucked dat stuff away. It no good to eat. Red metal clothes hurt troll teeth, and big whip thing get stuck in throat.",
    "You go help My Arm now.",
    "If you not paying attention, Burntmeat not going to talk to you!",
    "Yep, I remember. See, when you come here asking me 'bout goutweed dat other time, I tell you how we trolls had picked it all, and it not grow no more.",
    "Yah. But Burntmeat is hearing where goutweed is growing again.",
    "Well, I was cooking dis adventurer...",
    "You get on with helping My Arm, yah?",
    "So now we can grow goutweed whenever we want it?",
    "T'ank you so much! I dunno what we'd have done if you not come through here to help us.",
    "Oh yup, Burntmeat cooked you SPECIAL reward.",
    "LOTS of burnt meat!",
    "See, Burntmeat promised you a reward! Anyway, it been nice to see you again, Player. Enjoy your meal.",
    "Burntmeat hope you like your reward. It very special recipe Burntmeat learned when much younger troll.",
    "Ah, you polite human. Off you go now and see what My Arm want.",
    "Human so funny, pretending [he/she] don't like lovely burnt meat! Off you go now and see what My Arm wants.",
    "How you an' My Arm getting on with da goutweed?",
    "Death Plateau, huh? Dat's quite a long way. Do you know how to get dere?",
    "Okieday. Just you mind out for dem troll cooks on Death Plateau - dey not as friendly as Burntmeat.",
    "Okieday, listen up an' Burntmeat tell you da best way to Death Plateau...",
    "You go out da north door of my kitchen an' walk all da way down da corridor.",
    "Turn right at da end, and go down da stairs to da prison where we keep meat fresh.",
    "Yup. Can't keep people in crates like goutweed, dey go all dead an' smelly. Burntmeat tried it.",
    "Walk straight through da prison. Da back door of da Stronghold is at da south end.",
    "Dat is correct. Now you gettin' outside...",
    "When you outside, you turn left an' go long way south-east along path.",
    "At the end, you gotta turn left for Death Plateau. You got da special boots, so you gonna be okay on da rocks there.",
    "At the end, you gotta turn left for Death Plateau. But watch out for da tricky rocks - maybe you gonna have trouble climbing dem.",
    "Burntmeat heard where da humans going on Death Plateau wear funny boots to help climb rocks. Dey get da boots from little dwarf woman wot lives near da plateau. Turn right to go to her house.",
    "Aww! You hurry up an' get My Arm what he wanting.",
    "How you an' My Arm getting on with da goutweed?",
    "Da cooks on da plateau not as good as Burntmeat.",
    "How you an' My Arm getting on with da goutweed?",
    "Huh... Let me know when we got goutweed growing.",
    "How you an' My Arm getting on with da goutweed?",
    "Good, good. You get up there an' help him with dat.",
    "How you an' My Arm getting on with da goutweed?",
    "Urrrgh. You know how to read?",
    "Phew. Burntmeat got worried there for a moment.",
    "How you an' My Arm getting on with da goutweed?",
    "Dat soundin' like fun.",
    "Dis is kitchen! It hy-geen-ik place, an' Burntmeat not keep dung in it. What kinda place you from where dey keep dung in da kitchen?",
    "How you an' My Arm getting on with da goutweed?",
    "Nice work! Keep it up.",
    "How you an' My Arm getting on with da goutweed?",
    "How you an' My Arm getting on with da goutweed?",
    "It sound like it coming on good. You doin' well. Burntmeat give you nice reward when you finished.",
    "How you an' My Arm getting on with da goutweed?",
    "Huh - Burntmeat is sure you can handle 'em.",
    "How you an' My Arm getting on with da goutweed?",
    "Burntmeat glad to hear it. I gotta finish cooking your reward quick. Dis gotta be good 'cos you help us so much."

  "Player": [
    "I probably won't feel happy for knowing the answer to this, but why have you been thinking about me?",
    "You're disgusting! I'm not helping you again.",
    "What do you want now?",
    "Yes, you told me trolls had picked it all until there wasn't any left.",
    "Oh? How did you hear that?",
    "You killed that poor chap! What had he ever done to you?",
    "Anyway, why did you tell me about all that?",
    "You want to become a farmer?",
    "Your assistant's called WHAT?",
    "My...?",
    "But why is he called...",
    "Alright, enough! What do you want me to do for this Arm person?",
    "Look, you're a vicious monster who eats innocent people! Why should I ever help you again?",
    "Never?",
    "Can I have all that dragon stuff as my reward?",
    "When you were telling me about the man you cooked who talked about goutweed, there was loads of valuable stuff on the floor. Can I have it? PLEASE!",
    "Gah! You're worse than the old man who wouldn't give me his hat!",
    "...",
    "Alright, I'll lend him a hand. But you'd better keep that promise about not cooking any more people!",
    "You were about to tell me about some job...",
    "Right, you told me the only goutweed anywhere in the world was in your storage room.",
    "Oh? How did you hear that?",
    "Okay, okay, I'll do it.",
    "Before I start helping you with the whole farming thing, could you just explain why you're called My Arm?",
    "Okay, so what did you try to eat?",
    "And no one thinks it's a silly name?",
    "Okay, okay, I'm sorry! (snigger)",
    "Alright, My Arm (snigger snigger), tell me about it.",
    "So what do we do about it?",
    "There's no need for that. I already have a tuber. Do you want to see it?",
    "But there's no point in worrying about some weird lump on Death Plateau when I've got a tuber.",
    "Hmph.",
    "Why do I need to go there? Can't I just get you a proper gout tuber?",
    "Hmph.",
    "No, not yet.",
    "What was it you wanted?",
    "No! Just tell me what it was you wanted.",
    "Oh yes, how could I forget?",
    "Yes, I have it. Here, take the thing.",
    "So are you.",
    "You ate it!",
    "So what are you going to do now?",
    "Alright. Where do you need me to start?",
    "What did you plant?",
    "And none of those things grew?",
    "So did you try getting help from someone who knows about farming?",
    "You're not very clever, are you?",
    "Oh, nothing. Maybe I should see where you've been doing all this farming?",
    "It's a bit windy up here.",
    "I wash more than enough!",
    "So you think you could grow things here?",
    "Where in the world did YOU get a book?",
    "Farmer Gricoller's Farming Manual?",
    "Alright, I'll have a look inside.",
    "Of course I can read it! Just give me a moment.",
    "No thanks, that won't be necessary.",
    "Of course; I've been reading it.",
    "There's a useful section about preparing soil for growing crops. For a mountain area, it says we need to mix three buckets of camel dung and seven buckets of supercompost into the soil.",
    "Fortunately, I've got enough dung with me.",
    "Thanks a lot!",
    "Have you any dung in the Stronghold I could use?",
    "It was worth a try.",
    "Ask a camel for dung?",
    "How handy - I've got an amulet that lets me talk to camels.",
    "How handy - I'm already carrying my Camulet.",
    "Okay, I guess it's time for me to dig that old Camulet out of the bank.",
    "Of course, it'd be silly for me to ask a camel. I can't talk to camels. But I do remember getting some camel dung before, in some desert town once...",
    "No, not yet. I'm working on it.",
    "I need a spade to dig the supercompost in properly.",
    "I'm not mixing dung into the soil with my hands! I need a spade to dig it in properly.",
    "Unfortunately the book definitely said SUPERcompost.",
    "Great, that's enough supercompost.",
    "Phew - that's enough dung.",
    "My Arm can tend the patch himself. I'm not growing the goutweed for him.",
    "I've finished treating that soil patch for you.",
    "So what do we need to do now?",
    "We don't need to go there. I've got a gout tuber.",
    "You really need to be more flexible.",
    "It's a long way to Tai Bwo Wannai Village. We're going to need a boat...",
    "That is My Arm. We'd like to go to Karamja.",
    "He's a troll. His name is My Arm.",
    "Never mind that now, we just want to go to Karamja. Can you take us?",
    "Will you take us to Karamja?",
    "Either you can take us to Karamja, or you can discuss it with My Arm.",
    "So you'll take us?",
    "I think I'll come back another time.",
    "Oh, he'll be fine just standing here.",
    "I have to ask Captain Barnaby to let us onto his ship.",
    "What?",
    "What's wrong with your ar... What's wrong with you?",
    "Um... can't think of any just now.",
    "Aren't there... river trolls and sea trolls and things? They seem happy enough in the sea.",
    "But they look just like land trolls!",
    "Oh, please yourself!",
    "No! Look - no land.",
    "Still. No. Land.",
    "No, no.",
    "I'm not angry with you.",
    "What?",
    "Oh, he's gone. I hope he knows the way to Tai Bwo Wannai Village.",
    "Yes, that's right. I've been here before when the villagers thought their village was cursed. I had to fetch some special herbs for their shaman.",
    "I usually get something. Except that time when Burntmeat made me fetch him a 'tasty human' for his stew. All he gave me was some burnt meat.",
    "Believe it or not, I didn't like it at all.",
    "Murcaily, right.",
    "I'll get around to it.",
    "Have you seen My Arm around here?",
    "What? Oh, forget I said that! Have you seen a troll around here?",
    "Dratted creature - where can he be? He was meant to be coming here.",
    "Let's see... I saw him in Brimhaven, but he ran off. He was coming this way to your village.",
    "Thanks!",
    "A troll called My Arm wants a favour from you. He wants to grow goutweed and he thinks you can help.",
    "I really don't want to discuss it. Can you help this creature grow goutweed?",
    "No, the silly troll won't listen. He had me bring him all the way down from the mountains to ask you about it.",
    "You mean we aren't going to be able to grow it in the mountains?",
    "Oh, wonderful. Can you give me some of those, please?",
    "You owe me a bit of favour for the work I've been doing around the village. Are you sure you can't let me have some hardy gout tubers for the troll?",
    "So this hardy tuber will grow like any other herb seed?",
    "Roughly how much more favour do I need?",
    "I don't suppose you'd accept trading sticks instead?",
    "I was asking you about hardy goutweed...",
    "Fair enough.",
    "So this hardy tuber will grow like any other herb seed?",
    "What the heck was all THAT about?",
    "You could have really damaged their village!",
    "If you ever come to (Location of player-owned house), I'm not letting you into my house.",
    "Yes, I've got plenty of hardy gout tubers.",
    "What do you think I need from the bank?",
    "The birds got interested in watching your farm?",
    "Exactly how BIG was this bird?",
    "Are we talking bigger than... a pigeon?",
    "Actually, I seem to have thrown it away.",
    "Can I have some more hardy gout tubers?",
    "Thank you very much.",
    "No, he wasn't.",
    "I told him he'd better take us back, or else...",
    "Or else I'd let my arm loose on him.",
    "How are you going to get back to the Troll Stronghold?",
    "Alright, I'll see you there.",
    "What did you say?",
    "Riiight. Shall we get on with growing the goutweed now?",
    "Ok, I'll hand you what you need, and you can use it on the patch.",
    "Well, you've got a nice crop of weeds.",
    "Yeah, yeah, we'll get to that in a bit.",
    "We should start by raking it.",
    "The patch is free from weeds, so we could plant a hardy tuber in it.",
    "Well, I suppose we could treat the soil with compost first.",
    "Oh... there should be more of it than that. Sorry.",
    "Oh... there should be more of it than that. Sorry.",
    "Oh yes, you'll need the gout tubers.",
    "Aww, poor dwarfie. But he's sure to turn up again one of these days - drunken dwarves always keep coming back...",
    "The goutweed plant's got diseased. We should cure it quickly before it dies.",
    "Yes, I have some plant cure here.",
    "No, I didn't bring any.",
    "The goutweed's growing. Murcaily said it wouldn't take long.",
    "You're worried about that?",
    "What other birdie?",
    "Yep, you can harvest it now.",
    "Alright, I think I can arrange a spade for you.",
    "I'm just glad the goutweed grew up okay.",
    "Don't eat it all!",
    "...",
    "Thanks, I'll remember that.",
    "No, I haven't asked him yet.",
    "We've done it! My Arm's managed to grow some goutweed on the roof of the Stronghold!",
    "Yes, he's got plenty of hardy gout tubers to grow in his little farming patch.",
    "So... you mentioned a reward?",
    "...",
    "Yes, it was very... kind of you.",
    "That was the worst quest reward EVER! I get better things from killing goblins! I get better things from killing SPIDERS! Why in the world did I ever do a quest for a troll? I could have been training my skills instead! I could have trained a cat and got a load of death runes! But no, I did a quest for a troll, and what did I get? BURNT MEAT! What am I meant to do with burnt meat? I don't WANT burnt meat!",
    "No, he jolly well didn't. He gave me burnt meat. Again!",
    "You said you might be able to give me something better?",
    "Aha!",
    "He wants me to fetch something from a cauldron on Death Plateau.",
    "I am a navigational genius; I'll be fine.",
    "This place is a maze. Got any advice?",
    "A prison where you keep meat fresh?",
    "...",
    "Okay, so I've gone northwards up the corridor, down the stairs, then southwards through the prison.",
    "How do I get to Death Plateau if I can't climb the rocks?",
    "Thanks, you've been remarkably helpful, considering that you're a horrible monster who eats innocent people.",
    "So far he's had me go to Death Plateau to fetch a weird lump from the cauldron there.",
    "So far he's had me fetch some kind of lump from a pot on Death Plateau. I can't imagine what he'll want next.",
    "Yeah, whatever.",
    "He's shown me a place on the roof where he wants to grow the goutweed.",
    "He gave me a book to read.",
    "Of course I can read!",
    "I have to make a farming patch on the roof.",
    "Not really. I need camel dung. Have you got any?",
    "Oh well, can't blame a guy/girl for trying.",
    "I suppose I've done worse things before.",
    "Well, I've made a farming patch on the roof.",
    "He's somewhere near Tai Bwo Wannai Village. There's a man there called Murcaily whom we need to ask for help.",
    "Our little trip to Karamja was a bit... hectic. We just have to grow the goutweed now.",
    "The birds around here are a bit strange.",
    "It's ready for harvesting.",
    "Thanks a lot... Probably."

  "Adventurer": [
    "You like my armour? If you let me go, I'll let you keep it!",
    "You can have that too! Just let me go!",
    "No! I-I- I grew that myself!",
    "No, no; I grew it.",
    "You can get the gout tuber from Tai Bwo Wannai Village. Go there and ask Murcaily. Then you plant it in a farming patch.",
    "Oh b..."
  ],
  "My Arm": [
    "Yep, My Arm.",
    "Dat's easy! You know we trolls named after der first thing wot we try to eat when we young?",
    "It were my dad's arm. I remember it look so big holding me, I just gotta give it a chew. So he done named me My Arm.",
    "Well, I seen worse. Most humans come through here, dey got names with like all numbers and things wot aren't even words!",
    "If you happy 'bout my name now, I tell you 'bout dis farming job.",
    "Okieday. Now, I heard 'bout dese gouty thingies before. Da cooks up on Death Plateau were saying dey cooked a man wot had a lump in his pocket dat tasted like goutweed, but wasn't goutweed.",
    "My Arm is thinking this is da thingy we need.",
    "You go to Death Plateau and search da big cooking pot for da goutweedy lump!",
    "Just do as I say, yah?",
    "I not want to see your tuber! My Arm is organised troll who gets one thing done at a time. I need da goutweedy lump from da cooking pot on Death Plateau.",
    "Never mind tubers. You fetch me da goutweedy lump from da cooking pot of Dung 'n' Ash on Death Plateau.",
    "Go see Burntmeat - he give good directions for getting there.",
    "You got da goutweedy lump yet?",
    "You go getting yourself a move on, yah? My Arm getting bored. Ask Burntmeat if you needin' help findin' da place.",
    "You is a bit forgetful. If you like, My Arm give you nice tap on head to clear out cobbiewebs from brain.",
    "Okieday, maybe some other time. Now, what you gotta do is go to Death Plateau and fetch me da goutweedy lump from da big cooking pot.",
    "Perhaps you is a bit thick in da head. Ask Burntmeat if you needin' help findin' da place.",
    "You got da goutweedy lump yet?",
    "Huh. It looking a bit tatty...",
    "... but it smelling like goutweed.",
    "Yep, it tasting like goutweed too.",
    "You done good fetching dat goutweedy lump. My Arm very impressed.",
    "Well, now My Arm know dese goutweedy lump things exist, you help me grow one, yah?",
    "My Arm done tried farming before. I stick all kindsa things in da ground, but nothing ever grow, not even when I water 'em.",
    "I bin planting everythin', Player. Sticks, rocks, dead goats... you name it.",
    "Nope, not even a smidgen. My Arm dug 'em up again to see.",
    "Yah, My Arm found a nice farmer and ate him, but he not help much. He taste kinda boring too.",
    "My ol' mum say I clever enough. What you getting at?",
    "Sure t'ing, Player. I show you...",
    "Hurry up, Player!",
    "Dis is Troll Generals' cave.",
    "Climb up 'ere.",
    "Dis is my quiet place. No other trolls come up here. It where I bin trying to grow stuff.",
    "Dat is good, cos you smellin' distinctly whiffy. It like you got all dung in your pockets or something. Or maybe you needing a wash.",
    "Okieday, maybe My Arm imagining da smell.",
    "Yup, but My Arm not mind. We trolls not get blown around by wind like diddy little humans.",
    "I t'ink so, yah. I got book 'bout farming for you to read.",
    "Dat farmer I ate had a book with him. My Arm is hopin' you knows how to read.",
    "My Arm not know what in book, so you read it, yuh? Perhaps it tell you how to grow t'ings up on mountain.",
    "You know how to read book I got off farmer?",
    "If you forget how to read, it not a problem. My Arm give you little tap on head and maybe you remember again, no trouble.",
    "You know how to read book I got off farmer?",
    "Dat's good. Is it any use?",
    "Urgh. Dat's a lotta camel dung.",
    "My Arm not like to say so earlier, but you bin smellin' like you done a whoopsie.",
    "Why you think trolls keep dung in Stronghold? Do you keep dung in your house?",
    "You could go ask a camel for some dung. I bet dey got plenty.",
    "Best way to get somefing: find someone who got plenty of it wot they don't want.",
    "Clever human. Off you go now.",
    "Clever human. Off you go now.",
    "That could help. Off you go now.",
    "My Arm is sure you'll find some way to get dung out of a camel. Now trot along.",
    "You put all dat dung and stuff in da soil yet?",
    "You be getting move on, [Player].",
    "Good, good. Always I bin wanting a farming patch to grow things in. Da soggy bits south of here, they not work at all.",
    "Now we do like dat man say to Burntmeat. We gotta go to Tai Bwo Wannai Village and see Murcaily 'bout growing goutweed.",
    "I not wanna be gettin' confused with your tuber. Man tell Burntmeat we need to go see Murcaily to grow goutweed, so dat where we going.",
    "Trolls not flexible creatures. Humans too flexible; dey got little necks wot snap easy as anything.",
    "Yup, My Arm.",
    "It was my dad's arm.",
    "My Arm tried to eat it.",
    "What we waitin' for here?",
    "Okieday, My Arm gonna let you do the talking. He not seem to like me standin' here.",
    "Urrrgh.",
    "My Arm not liking dis.",
    "You ever hear stories of troll sailors or troll pirates?",
    "Dat 'cos trolls don't like da sea. We kinda sink.",
    "Them not proper trolls. Proper trolls live in mountains.",
    "We trolls. Them not trolls. 'Nuff said.",
    "Are we dere yet?",
    "How 'bout now?",
    "You gettin' angry with My Arm, huh?",
    "Is it 'cos I is thick?",
    "Oh, right.",
    "Are we dere now?",
    "Urrrgh! My Arm feeling sick...",
    "We will meet at da village, yah?",
    "So dis is Tai Bwo Wannai Village, huh?",
    "You doin' a lot of favours for people. Is dere anything in it for you?",
    "You not like Burntmeat's cooking?",
    "Dat a pity. He planning to give you more burnt meat when you done helpin' me. Maybe My Arm think of something better for you. But first you go find Murcaily - he gotta help us grow goutweed.",
    "You done spoken to Murcaily 'bout goutweed yet?",
    "You slow. My Arm gettin' bored.",
    "You take far too long chattin' with Murcaily. My Arm come in to hurry things up.",
    "Silly humans got such flimsy homes. One good thump an' der walls come down.",
    "Anyway, you got da goutweedy stuff, right?",
    "Right. Let's get back to da ship an' go back to Ardougne. My Arm fink you need to go to da bank.",
    "See, [Player], My Arm done tried planting stuff before, an' da birds around Trollheim Mountain, dey got... interested.",
    "Yuh, an' dere was a great BIG one wot started trying to eat whatever I planted.",
    "It pretty BIG. You might wanna get some food an' stuff.",
    "How 'bout we just go back to Ardougne so you can get your fightin' stuff...",
    "You is dumber than a spotted kebbit! Go back an' ask Murcaily for some more!",
    "Dat captain didn't look very happy to see us again.",
    "What was dat you said to him?",
    "Or else what?",
    "So... are we dere yet?",
    "You probably wanna go to bank now to fetch yer fightin' stuff. When you finished, go back to da Troll Stronghold. My Arm gonna be waitin' by our farming patch on da roof.",
    "Dat not your problem.",
    "Ah, dulce domum.",
    "It mean somefing like 'Home sweet home' in some old language. My Arm is well ed-oo-cated troll, not some no-brain rockhead.",
    "Yup, dat sound good. You show me how to do dat.",
    "How's my farming coming along?",
    "I not go to all dis trouble to grow weedies! You supposed to help me grow goutweed!",
    "You give me what stuff I need to use on da patch and I use it. And hurry up, My Arm gettin' bored.",
    "Okieday, you gimme a rake an' My Arm do it.",
    "Already?",
    "After dat you probably wanna give me da hardy gout tuber thingies, an' maybe somefing to poke 'em into da soil.",
    "Also, I got plenty of da hardy gout tuber thingies, but I gonna need somefing to poke 'em into da soil.",
    "T'anks, [Player].",
    "Nuffing' interesting happened.",

    "Dat lookin' a bit short!",
    "What you t'ink I want with a stick, huh?",
    "I can't get da goutweed thing in da ground with all these weeds here.",
    "Da weedies look healthy enough, t'anks",
    "Don't I need somefing to plant?",
    "You a dwarf. You not my matey!",

    "Save da goutweed!",
    "It gonna eat da goutweed - kill it, quick!",
    "T'anks for saving da goutweed, [Player]. But I fink dis other birdie not happy with you...",
    "Dat birdie behind you.",
    "Aaaargh!",
    "Ah, lovely goutweed all grown up.",

    "T'ank you so much for all da help! Burntmeat gonna be very pleased.",
    "My Arm just check dis da right stuff...",
    "Yup, dis is goutweed. It lovverley.",
    "Aww, too late.",
    "You gotta go back to kitchen an' tell Burntmeat da good news. Maybe he give you nice reward for all da hard work you bin doin' for us. But if he not give you anyfing good, you come back an' see My Arm.",
    "Did Burntmeat give you nice reward?",
    "He downstairs in da kitchen. An' if he give you somefing rubbish, come tell My Arm. Maybe I can reward you better.",
    "Did Burntmeat give you nice reward?",
    "Aww, dat a shame. See, Burntmeat like burnt meat. It his favourite thing to cook, an' he do it better than any other troll.",
    "Yup, an' I will. My Arm gonna tell you big hushy-hushy secret about herbs...",
    "Now you know more 'bout herbs. Also, I made a new farming patch like you showed me. Whatever you plant in it, I make sure it don't get disease."

    "I do not know what one of those is, Bwana, but I am sure there are none in our village.",
    "Well, Bwana, when I am looking for someone, I find it helps to think about where they may be. If your friend was travelling this way, he is surely between here and the place where you last saw him.",
    "Then perhaps you should look for your friend along the route to Brimhaven.",
    "Is there anything I can do for you, Bwana?",
    "What's a troll? And what was that about your arm, Bwana?",
    "Goutweed? People grow it in farming patches all the time. Have you tried planting a gout tuber in your patch?",
    "You want to grow it in the mountains, Bwana? That might be more difficult. Gout tubers only grow well in warm places with plenty of sun.",
    "No, not with a normal gout tuber. Those just won't survive the conditions. You'll need a special hardy gout tuber.",
    "Oh no, Bwana. Those are far too valuable to give away.",
    "Oh, I suppose I could let you have one. But only because you've got over sixty percent favour. If we didn't owe you so much for your help, I'd not be giving out hardy gout tubers.",
    "It grows much faster than any other I have seen, Bwana. But remember, although it is hardy enough to grow in the cold mountain lands, it may still become diseased.",
    "Oh, I hadn't thought of that...",
    "No, Bwana, I'm very sorry, but you'll need to do a bit more work for us before we'll be able to spare you any hardy gout tubers.",
    "Let me see... I think if you get it up to 60 percent, I'd be able to let you have a hardy gout tuber for your friend.",
    "Sorry, Bwana, but I don't need those. I get plenty of trading sticks from all the people wanting to use my hardwood grove. Hardy gout tubers are too precious to be bought like that.",
    "Yes, Bwana, I remember. You wanted a hardy gout tuber so your friend could grow goutweed on his mountain. But you only have (1 to 59) percent favour in our village. Come back to me with at least 60 percent favour and I will let you have what you need.",
    "Yes, Bwana, I remember. We owe you big-time for the work you done in Tai Bwo Wannai Village, so I can let you have a hardy gout tuber for your friend to grow on his mountain.",
    "It grows much faster than any other I have seen, Bwana. But remember, although it is hardy enough to grow in the cold mountain lands, it may still become diseased."
