The fight is divided into 3 phases, at the end of each phase you can bank and return to resume from that checkpoint`
Phase 1`
Fight against wights of increasing difficulty, kill enough of them to increase the progress bar on top.`
Use Deflect Melee or Deflect Missiles depending on the types of wights you are fighting`
Be aware that all remaining unstable wight footsoldiers will explode at the end of the wave, potentially causing death if the player is surrounded but you will continue onto the next wave when you return.`
Phase 2`
Note: This part of the fight can be extremely difficult. It is highly recommended to stand between the middle and western rifts at all times, beginning while Sliske is talking. This prevents Linza from attacking throughout the fight.`
Kill Nomad.`
Use Deflect Ranged while fighting him`
Nomad plants mines and Gregorovic rains damage on the arena. Make sure to walk off of marked tiles.`
Kill Linza the Disgraced.`
Use Deflect Melee while fighting her`
Linza reflects damage which is less deadly after she's the only surviving boss.`
She also has a blue charged bar that appears above her head and does a very high damage move. She will also bind before she does this move so have surge or freedom ready. It is recommended to dodge this attack.`
Kill Gregorovic.`
Use Deflect Ranged while fighting him`
The spirits that spawn towards Gregorovic will heal him if they reach him. Kill them before they touch him.`
Phase 3`
Kill Sliske. You cannot use Deathtouched darts to kill Sliske.`
Use Deflect Magic throughout the fight as the majority of the damage will be magic classed. Keep in mind that prayer points are drained faster than normal in this fight.`
If you are having trouble, wearing the Armour of Trials and wielding Vanquish can help greatly has it can provide a 25% defensive and offensive bonus during the fight if you die 5 times in a row.`
Beware of his special attack where several shadow pits will appear below your feet. Step away to avoid significant damage. He will summon 4 shadow pits in the first round, 5 in the second, and 4 in the subsequent two rounds.

Attack Sliske until he reaches 10,000 health, he will teleport away.`
Destroy the Power Source in the centre of the room.`
Attack Sliske until he reaches 10,000 health again.`
