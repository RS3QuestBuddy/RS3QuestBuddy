    "Hi Chuck. How's it going?",
    "Erm Chuck, could you remind me what the passphrase was?",
    "Thanks, I won't forget this time.",
    "Hmm, Chuck said to strike up a conversation. I wonder... Excuse me. Could I borrow a tinderbox?",
    "They do say they're better...",
    "The weather [holiday destination] is [weather] and [food] are to die for.",
    "Hello. Chuck sent me to find you. He said the penguins are up to something?",
    "In what way?",
    "Oh no!",
    "Why don't you two go?",
    "Fine. Hey can you feel that rumbling?!",
    "What did I just see?!",
    "Why don't you two go?",
    "...",
    "Hi Chuck. How's it going?",
    "I met the two PBJ agents, they said that Pescaling Pax is plotting to permanently lower the temperature of Gielinor! I was just about to head to the iceberg to check things out when we saw a blue box take off from there! It landed in the desert, Chuck!",
    "Yes sir!",
    "There's a small sign on it. It reads: Terraforming Arctic Refrigeration Dispersing Ice Spreader. Maybe this is how the penguins are planning to lower the temperature of Gielinor. Maybe I should see if anyone in the area saw what happened.",
    "Did you see what happened here?",
    "You can talk to crocodiles?!",
    "Could I try it out?",
    "But why?",
    "But aren't they quite vicious? How come one hasn't eaten you yet?",
    "I see... Do you think maybe you've been out in the desert a bit too long. Could I get you some water?",
    "... If the crocodiles don't get him, the jackals will...",
    "Er, nothing!",
    "I should equip my Crocspeak amulet if I want to talk to him.",
    "Er...Hello?",
    "What's wrong, brown croc?",
    "There, there. Calm down. It'll probably just melt soon.",
    "Yes, I saw...It seems to be some sort of terraforming machine.",
    "Time travel? But if that was possible, plot points could be reverted... And any narrative dead-end could be resolved with a cheap flick of the time-travel reset switch... Or something like that... Anyway, perhaps I'd better report back to Chuck.",
    "Not yet Croc. But don't worry, I'm working on it! Just think warm thoughts for now!",
    "So, you know Chuck eh?",
    "What happened? How did you end up here?",
    "There's a small sign on it. It reads: Terraforming Arctic Refrigeration Dispersing Ice Spreader. Maybe this is how the penguins are planning to lower the temperature of Gielinor. I should tell Chuck about this.",
    "Hi Chuck. How's it going?",
    "Chuck, I've got some more information about the penguin activities.",
    "They've built something called a Terraforming Arctic Refrigeration Dispersing Ice Spreader, or T.A.R.D.I.S. for short. It's landed in the desert and is now slowly changing the desert to an arctic tundra!",
    "I couldn't look too closely, there were several penguins wandering around nearby. But I did speak to an old friend of yours, called Croc?",
    "Croc was complaining that with all the ice that was coming out from the T.A.R.D.I.S. the desert was cold, and he wasn't very happy. Is there anything we can do?",
    "What's the agent's name?",
    "Oh... So how will I find him?",
    "But how will I be able to get into the disguise by myself?",
    "I think I misplaced my penguin disguise.",
    "Ok Chuck, I'll see what I can do...",
    "Hi Chuck. How's it going?",
    "Not yet, I'll get right on it.",

    "I can't get into my penguin disguise, I need my hands free to operate it.",
    "I can't get into my penguin disguise, I can't wear a cape inside the suit, it might get caught.",
    "I wouldn't want to break my penguin disguise.",
    "Hi!",
    "It's rather warm out here isn't it?",
    "Right...",
    "I'd love some ice cream...",
    "Aw. I'll pass, thanks.",
    "I er, banged my head. I went to lie down... I don't really remember what happened.",
    "Er... would you like a piece of pie?",
    "... Phew, that was close. Finding the PBJ agent is a bit of a puzzle, I need to consider the clues more logically...",
    "I er, banged my head. I went to lie down... I don't really remember what happened.",
    "Er... I said, it's very dry...",
    "... Phew, that was close. Finding the PBJ agent is a bit of a puzzle, I need to consider the clues more logically...",
    "Er... I said, I think I might cry.",
    "... Phew, that was close. Finding the PBJ agent is a bit of a puzzle, I need to consider the clues more logically...",
    "I don't understand...",
    "Chuck sent me to find you. What's happening here?",
    "Oh no! If only there was some way to stop them...",
    "What's that?",
    "Sounds good... so what have you been working on?",
    "What does it do?",
    "Huh?",
    "Wow!",
    "Wait, why can't you go?",
    "Fine... I'll help.",
    "It's not even finished?",
    "Ok thanks!",
    "Ok thanks!",
    "No, I got distracted...",
    "I need to be wearing my penguin disguise to go in there. I think Jim, the polar bear over there, will be able to help me.",
    "Hello?",
    "Erm, no, just who are you anyway?",
    "I think they've gone... You're like the only penguin still here.",
    "So what do you do around here then?",
    "Sails? Do you mean sales?",
    "I don't have anything to write with.",
    "No...",
    "Perfect, I'll buy it.",
    "What is this place, what am I doing here?",
    "Fininor, you mean Gielinor? Wait, nevermind, what are you two up to?",
    "No way?",
    "So what happened, why are you in a pillory instead of partying?",
    "That seems very egregious dudes, I mean unfair.",
    "I'll check it out and see what I can do. Hang in there.",
    "Hang in there. I'm sure there's something instrumental I can do around here to resolve the situation.",
    "Hang in there. I'm sure there's something instrumental I can do around here to resolve the situation.",
    "What's going on?",
    "What's wrong with them?",
    "Can I help?",
    "Hi Chuck. How's it going?",
    "Sorry Chuck, I just thought you might like a chat.",
    "But doesn't the nature of time travel mean that...",
    "I'll get right on it.",
    "Noodle! Is that you?",
    "Right...",
    "Wow, I guess you guys have been busy. Though, I guess humans have been blissfully ignoring us since changing to the 6th age and all.",
    "Yeah, sorry I knew that. Do you know anything about a T.A.R.D.I.S?",
    "Glad you landed on your flippers.",
    "Yeah, about that...",
    "Well, apart from using a G.P.S. device to locate the hidden hatch access, I literally entered the most common 4 digit 'fin' number. Bam, first try!",
    "Right...",
    "But penguins can swim...",
    "Alright, alright! Calm down, let's not be too hasty now.",
    "Well, I'm guessing that you don't need me to do any favours then?",
    "Dare I ask?",
    "Is that it?",
    "Well, that's good, given certain penguins kept losing them, and forgery and fraud rates were quite high.",
    "You really think they're listening in? Have you considered a different shape or you know, not making it out of easily fabricated 'card'?",
    "Hey, that er... party was really good right?",
    "Back to work then.",
    "Hey, what's with all the scaffolding?",
    "Should be good then.",
    "What's with the food these days?",
    "I could eat Macaroni Penguins and Cheese every day!",
    "What's going on?",
    "No, what happened?",
    "Really?",
    "Phew! How did they save him?",
    "Have you seen the weather outside?",
    "Would it be affected by the heat of say the desert?",

    "Erm, no?",
    "Yes sir! Right away sir!",
    "Hi, what are you up to?",
    "Hi, what are you up to?",

    "Hello.",
    "So... nice weather down here...",
    "Well, I best be getting along.",
    "Hi there!",
    "So... what do you do here?",
    "That's nice... Well, I best be getting along.",
    "My name is Player and I'm from the 6th age, your De-lore-ing device worked and you sent me back here to change the future.",
    "Whatever it is you were - I mean - are - working on here succeeds, but it crash landed in the desert and has started churning out ice to send Gielinor back to the freezer! I met you in the 6th age, and fixed your De-lore-ing device to allow me to come back here and stop it from happening.",
    "Guthix - no wait - I shouldn't tell you any more than you need to know. We need to stop the device from leaving this base by destroying it somehow!",
    "But we must stop it from freezing the world!",
    "You're right, how far along is the device and what can we do?",
    "Ok, I'll go and find Elon.",
    "Not yet, where can I find him?",
    "Ok.",
    "Hi, Gordon sent me, do you need some help?",
    "Sure what do you need?",
    "Ok, I'll take a look, and see what I can source.",
    "I lost the list you gave me...",
    "Er...",
    "I've brought you [item].",
    "I'm still looking for some of the things.",
    "Yes, he gave me a list of things to get.",
    "You've been here for ages and the most interesting conversation you had was with a Polar Bear?",
    "What's that Buzz, they've been trying to extract energy from you?",
    "A gift for me?",
    "I can get more energy from your friends, but they won't be so willing to hand it over?",
    "Can I get you out of here? I'll see what I can do. Stay positive.",
    "I've brought you the 121 Killerwatt Energy.",
    "I've brought you the 'Fishvention' Rod.",
    "I've brought you 1985 lemon sole runes.",
    "I've brought you the Ice box.",
    "I've brought you a Cool-ant.",
    "I think I've got everything...",
    "What kind?",
    "I have an idea... maybe some different types of divine energy would do the job?",
    "Er... nevermind, pretend you didn't hear anything! How much energy do you need?",
    "Ok, I'll be back soon.",
    "No... could you remind me what I needed to do?",
    "Ok, got it!",
    "The T.A.R.D.I.S. is nearly ready, I just need to configure the energy source.",
    "What's your plan?",
    "That seems a bit unnecesary, I'm on your side!",
    "...",
    "I finished calibrating the machine.",
    "Sir! The T.A.R.D.I.S. is complete, Sir!",
    "Yes, Sir! Gordon and Hugh, and then report to Emperor Wing so that we can leave!",
    "Yep.",
    "The T.A.R.D.I.S. is complete, we should prepare to leave!",
    "Ok... But make sure it's somewhere I can find it in the future!",
    "The T.A.R.D.I.S. is complete doc, we should prepare to leave!",
    "Sir! The T.A.R.D.I.S. is complete, and the crew are ready!",
    "Surely you can't be serious?",
    "Er... sure. What's the worst that could happen?",
    "What do you mean...another?",
    "What should we do then?",
    "Right, thanks. I'll be off then just in case.",
    "Can I get you out of here? I'll see what I can do. Stay positive.",
    "Hi Chuck. How's it going?",
    "I travelled back in time, and...",
    "Oh... But I don't understand... Gordon sabotaged the T.A.R.D.I.S. in the past, but it still landed in the desert and is making the area cold... Nothing changed!",
    "But what about all the ice? What about Gielinor?",
    "What about Croc, he'll still be cold?",
    "Oh...",
    "Hi Chuck. How's it going?",
    "Have you heard anything from Gordon recently?",
    "It's ok Croc, their machine can't make things any colder than they currently are... It's not working to its full capacity, and the heat of the desert will keep things under control.",
    "Why don't you scoot along the river a little?",
    "Hi Gordon! How's it going?",
    "What are you doing?",
    "Good luck!",

  "Chuck": [
    "Ah, Player. It's good to see you again.",
    "Funny you should ask. I've just had word from two PBJ agents that are on an observation mission. They've reported that there's been some unusual activity on the iceberg. Perhaps you could go and speak to them, and find out what's happening?",
    "Oh. Well come back if you change your mind.",
    "Splendid! The agents are called Skot and Mundsen, and are located in Rellekka. You may have difficulty spotting them, with their exceptional disguises! Go and strike up a conversation with them, and report back to me when you have more information... Oh, I almost forgot, you'll need a passphrase...",
    "The weather [holiday destination] is [weather] and [food] are to die for.",

    "The weather [holiday destination] is [weather] and [food] are to die for.",
    "Ah, Player. It's good to see you again.",
    "Well, what are you doing wasting time here? Get after them!",
    "Ah, Player. It's good to see you again.",
    "Go on...",
    "That's very worrying indeed! Did you get a get a good look at this T.A.R.D.I.S. device?",
    "Ah Croc, he used to live here in the zoo. He escaped a long time ago, but it's good to know he's still out there.",
    "Well, we do have one option. A while ago a PBJ agent was tasked with infiltrating extreme penguin cells. This group of penguins in the desert sounds pretty extreme, so maybe the agent is with them. He may be able to provide us with more information.",
    "His identity is so secret that even I don't know.",
    "You'll need to talk to the penguins in the desert and see if you can work out which is the undercover agent. The only thing I do know about him, is that his favorite food is sardines. Maybe that'll be some help. I suggest you take your penguin disguise with you, otherwise the penguins won't talk to you.",
    "The agent should have a device with him that will allow you to shrink into your disguise when you're nearby.",
    "As luck would have it, I have a spare here, but if you lose it I won't give you another.",
    "Ah, Player. It's good to see you again.",
    "Did you manage to find our agent in the desert?",
    "Ah, Player. It's good to see you again.",
    "Shouldn't you be in the past stopping the penguins from launching their Terraforming Arctic Refrigeration Dispersing Ice Spreader?",
    "There's no time for that, Player! The penguins must be stopped!",
    "You must hurry before the whole of Gielinor is permanently frozen!",
    "Ah, Player. It's good to see you again.",
    "Let me stop you right there, Gordon's sent a report over to me, I know all about it.",
    "Don't you see? The T.A.R.D.I.S. was already harmless when it landed, because it had already been sabotaged!",
    "Gielinor will be fine. The T.A.R.D.I.S. isn't working to full capacity, so the heat from the desert will keep the ice level under control.",
    "I'm sure he'll adapt. Besides, there's a whole wide desert he can explore.",
    "Don't be sad, have some rewards for your trouble.",
    "Ah, Player. It's good to see you again.",
    "He sends in reports when he can, via magic carpet. The penguins are trying to repair their T.A.R.D.I.S., but as you can imagine, it's almost impossible for them to get spare parts out there. Gielinor is safe for the time being!",

Its purpose is to change the whole of Gielinor to be a permanently frozen arctic tundra! As you can see, things haven't gone quite to plan, and we landed in the desert. But the machine is still gradually turning the desert into a giant ice rink!",

    "No, we must ensure the device is finished so we don't cause a time loop or paradox.",
    "Well we've had some supply problems and issues finding parts. You'll need to speak to Elon to find out more and see if you can help him. Meanwhile, I'll think of something to try and break out of this loop and stop it happening over and over.",
