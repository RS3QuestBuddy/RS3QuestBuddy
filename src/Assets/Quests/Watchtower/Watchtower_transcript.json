  ],
  "Watchtower Wizard": [
    "Who are you? Are you one of the new guards?",
    "Well what are you doing here?",
    "Oh my, oh my! What does it all matter in the end, anyway?",
    "Oh dear, oh dear. Darn and drat! We try hard to keep this town protected. But how can we do that when the Watchtower isn't working?",
    "The Watchtower here works by the power of magic. An ancient spell designed to ward off ogres that has been in place here for many moons. The exact knowledge of the spell is lost to us now, but the essence of the spell has been infused into four powering crystals that keep the tower protected from the hordes in the Feldips.",
    "The crystals! The crystals have been taken!",
    "Stolen!",
    "Yes, yes! Do I have to repeat myself?",
    "That's typical, nowadays. It's left to us wizards to do all the work.",
    "Help? Oh wonderful, dear traveller! Yes I could do with an extra pair of eyes here.",
    "There must be some evidence of what has happened here. Perhaps you could assist me in searching for clues?",
    "Try searching the surrounding area. If you find anything unusual, bring it here. Try the bushes - I've read enough adventure stories to know that clues get caught in bushes all the time. I will tell the guards to let you past - that way, you can just use the ladder to get in and out.",
    "Hmph! Suit yourself.",
    "Complaining? Complaining! What folks these days don't realise is that if it weren't for us wizards, this entire world would be overrun with every creature you could possibly imagine. And some you couldnt[sic] even conceive of!",
    "Hello again. Did you find anything of interest?",
    "Oh dear, oh dear, there must be something, somewhere...",
    "Hello again. Did you find anything of interest?",
    "Let me see...",
    "No, sorry, this is not evidence. You need to keep searching, I'm afraid.",
    "Interesting, very interesting. Long nails...grey in colour...well chewed... Of course! They belong to a skavid!",
    "A servant race to the ogres: grey, depressed-looking creatures, always losing nails, teeth and hair! They inhabit the caves in the Feldip Hills. They normally keep to themselves, though. It's unusual for them to venture from their caves.",
    "It's no good searching the caves. Well, not yet, anyway.",
    "They are deep and complex. The only way you will navigate the caves is to have a map or something. It may be that the ogres have one...",
    "Well... I don't.",
    "You need to be fearless and gain entrance to Gu'Tanoth, the city of the ogres, then find out how to navigate the caves.",
    "Ogres are nasty creatures, yes. Only a strong warrior, and a clever one at that, can get the better of them.",
    "Well, the guards need to be dealt with. You could start by checking out the ogre settlements found around here. Tribal ogres often dislike their neighbours...",
    "In the meantime, I'll throw those fingernails out for you.",
    "Won't bother? Won't bother! Perhaps this quest is too hard for you?",
    "Ah, it's part of an old ogre statue. I'll see if I can fix it up for you. It might come in handy. There may be more parts to find... I'll keep this for later.",
    "Excellent! That seems to be all the pieces. Now I can assemble it...",
    "How is the quest going?",
    "My, my. A wordsmith as well as a hero.",
    "Take some illumination with you or else it will be dark.",
    "Yes, it will be well guarded. Hmmm, let me see... Ah yes, I gather some ogres are allergic to certain herbs. Now what was it? It had white berries and blue leaves.... Cave nightshade, thats it! You should try looking through some of the caves.",
    "And don't forget to look out for the dragons!",
    "Dragons. Didn't you know that the ogres keep blue dragons as pets and for magical ingredients? Well, regardless, I'm sure a bold, brave adventurer such as yourself won't have any problems.",
    "That's good to hear. We are much closer to fixing the tower now.",
    "That is because of their magical powers. We must fight them with their own methods; do not speak to them! I suggest a potion... Collect a guam leaf, add some jangerberries, then mix in some ground bat bones. It is essential to return it to me before you use it, so that I can empower it with my magic. Be very careful how you mix it as it is extremely volatile. Mixing ingredients of this type in the wrong order can cause explosions! I hope you've been brushing up Herblore and Magic? I must warn you, only experienced magicians can use the potion. It is too dangerous in the hands of the unskilled.",
    "Any more news?",
    "Yes indeed, let me see, what was it again...",
    "You need a guam leaf.",
    "Wonderful! You will need to add that first.",
    "You will also need a guam leaf. That goes into the mix first.",
    "You need some jangerberries.",
    "Wonderful! You will need to add those after the guam leaf has gone in, but before the other ingredient.",
    "You will also need some jangerberries. Those go into the mix before the final ingredient.",
    "The final ingredient is ground bat bones.",
    "A pestle and mortar will more than do the trick.",
    "Yes, those will do nicely.",
    "When you have mixed the potion correctly, then I can empower the potion with magic and the ogre shamans can be destroyed.",
    "Any more news?",
    "That's great news; let me infuse it with magic...",
    "Here it is - a dangerous substance. I must remind you that this potion can only be used if your Magic level is high enough.",
    "Well, if you can cast Bones to Bananas, or any spells beyond that, you should be alright.",
    "Hello again. Did the potion work?",
    "May you have success in your task.",
    "Hello again. Did the potion work?",
    "Magnificent! At last you've brought all the crystals. Now the shield generator can be activated and, once again, Yanille will be safe from the threat of the ogres. Put the crystals on the pillars there and throw the lever to activate the system.",
    "The system is not activated yet. Throw the switch to start it.",
    "Marvellous! It works! The town will now be safe. Your help was invaluable. Take this payment as a token of my gratitude. Also, let me improve your Magic level for you. Here is a special item for you - it's a new spell. Read the scroll and you will be able to teleport yourself here.",
    "Greetings, friend. I trust all is well with you? Yanille is safe at last!",
    "Never mind, have another...",
    "Ho, ho, ho! A comedian to the finish. There it is, in your backpack!",

    "That's not tricky - guards!",
    "The morsel is back. Does it have our tooth for us?",
    "Morsel, you dare to return without the tooth! Either you are stoopid, or wants to be eaten!",

    "Hahaha! Small t'ing returns. Did you bring the dragon bone?",
    "Then you shall get nothing from me!",
    "Hahaha! Small t'ing has done it. Toban is glad, but you can't hold his reward; you'd best put somet'ing down.",
