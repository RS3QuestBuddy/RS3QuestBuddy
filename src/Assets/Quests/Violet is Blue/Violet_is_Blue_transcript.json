Or a giant terrifying tree monster that uses vines to ensnare it's prey...[sic] ...or big demons that look like mummies but actually have claws longer than their limbs! I should probably do the right thing and make sure that the monster doesn't eat her...",

    "Really!",
    "Really really!",
    "Everything? It looks like you've got an awful lot of stuff here. Let's only take essentials shall we?",

    "Ummm. Thought it was the first letter?",
    "Nope, can I have the letter again please?",

    "How can I extract syrup from the trees?",

    "That's a good question! I should probably look round to see if there's a use for it.",
    "We'll have to light the way.",
    "I'll take a look around and see if I can find you something.",
    "I've got you a firefly to hold.",
    "You're not supposed to eat it! It's for lighting the way.",
    "I'll have to find another way...",
    "If I give you a firefly you're just going to eat it!",
    "There must be another way to light the way using the fireflies.",
    "I've covered as much of the dark area as I can with syrup which should attract the fireflies to them. This should light the way for us.",
    "As we run through I need you to let the fireflies out the jar so they fly to the syrup and give us light! No eating them!",
    "It's a jar.",
    "I've caught x fireflies.",
    "Oh wow, a bucket!",
    "I can put something inside this.",
    "How does something so tasty just come out of a tree?",
    "It's a maple tree...",
    "Where did you learn this?",
    "Is it though?",
    "I don't know.",
    "I should find a way of getting some sticky maple.",
    "I can get syrup from the tree now!",
    "Brilliant, there is a spile in this tree which will give me syrup. Now I just need something to collect it in.",
    "Syrup! This will be perfect for keeping the fireflies in place.",
    "I could craft this into a spile that would help me obtain the syrup from the trees.",
    "A spile used for extracting syrup from trees.",
    "Shake it off!",
    "Doesn't seem to be anything here.",
    "I've got nothing to hold them with.",
    "Perfect! Violet can hold this whilst we go through the forest.",
    "I've already got a firefly for Violet to hold.",
    "I don't have enough room to catch more. I could break the jar but then I'd have to submit a bug report.",
    "Violet could hold this so it lights the way!",
    "This looks like a great spot to place a makeshift light to light the way.",
    "This looks like a great spot to place a makeshift light to light the way. If I can find a way to extract the sticky syrup from a tree I might be able to use that to atract[sic] the fireflies to this, lighting the way.",
    "That appears to be all the surfaces I could possibly cover. I should tell Violet the next step of the plan.",
    "This is sticky and should attract fireflies helping to light the way.",
    "Violet! Don't run too far ahead! Look out!",
    "That's a good thing. It means they won't see us sneaking past!",
    "Sure, let's make them some makeshift heads.",
    "I'll take a look around! Meanwhile make sure you don't go running off as there could be dangerous things ahead!",
    "Where do you get such pinpoint aim?",
    "Should we get going?",
    "That will take way too long.",
    "Before you get attached to them we should go...",
    "Are you having fun?",
    "Glad to hear!",
    "Can you help me get home? I'll return to help Violet soon.",
    "How about using this snow to make the heads?",
    "If I compact the snow hard enough together, it will hold together and work just fine! How do you think snowmen are made?",
    "A man made of snow.",
    "That looks like we have enough. How do you suggest we go about giving them the heads?",
    "I'll point them out and you hit them? Sound good?",
    "Sounds like a good plan.",
    "Phew... what a walk...",
    "I am! I'm just not used to such a snowy terrain. Anyway what do we have here?",
    "We need to find a way across this lake, but that ice does not look safe.",
    "Hmm... well we'll need to find another way round. Say, I don't suppose you know a way?",
    "Are you sure? You did say it had been years since you've been to town.",
    "Okay, okay! I didn't mean it like that. All I mean is there has to be a way we can get round without risking Violet's life on the ice.",
    "Violet you did it!",
    "You gave me an idea! We can use Violet's roars to cause more snow to fall and thicken up the ice, that should make it safe enough to cross.",
    "STOP! I'm sure you have a great roar but this is Violet's adventure remember? You keep her busy while I give her something else to roar at.",
    "That's it, keep practicing your roar and I'll build these snowmen.",
    "Look, Violet, another snowman!",
    "That's it, Violet!",
    "Not yet. I need to build some snowmen and Violet's roar should be able to knock snow from the trees to help strengthen the ice.",
    "That looks like enough snow for now.",
    "I'm going to be sycamore of seeing branches if I prune anymore.",
    "In this moment, I realise the inevitability of life is that you are but a moment away from death. Life can feel so solid, but really you are just compacted ice on a winter's day. Sunshine, a swift kick or a roar to the face can change everything. Snowman... oh, snowman... you went before we could truly appreciate you. But I will honour you.",
    "This day, and each that follows, I will carry a small piece of you in my heart.",
    "That's what I'm about to figure out. We're going to need to find some way of getting you across safely first though.",
    "Violet, how would you like to ride the barrel express? Next stop: Yeti Town!",
    "An adventurer must be prepared for any eventuality. You'd be amazed by the things you can use on each other to get bizarre interactions.",
    "Onwards to Yeti Town! Taking on whatever this journey throws at us one step at a time.",
    "Alright, are you ready for this?",
    "No, move your leg over there!",
    "Right, twist. A bit more. A bit more.",
    "Come on! It's like you're not even trying!",
    "The lake looks pretty slippy. We should probably find a safe way to get Violet across. What's a good way of making this a fun adventure? I should look around for supplies.",
    "Well, here goes nothing!",
    "Are you ready, Violet?",
    "Phew! I made it.",
    "I knew I was forgetting something...",
    "Violet, we did it!",
    "Maybe later, right now we have to get you to Yeti Town. But how are we going to get your dad across?",
    "That was incredible!",
    "What's up, Violet?",
    "What is it?",
    "Now, why would they not want to be friends, with you?",
    "You are brave, fun and lovable, and now one of the world's greatest adventurers! The kids will be lining up to be your friend!",
    "I sure do! Now, what do you say we figure out how to get down there and make the best entrance ever? That slope is too steep to walk down. We need to find a safe way of getting down there.",
    "Let's do it!",
    "You're in charge. What do we need to do?",
    "What do you think we should do next?",
    "I don't think I'd be able to take both of you sitting on me. I'll have a look around to see if there is anything we could use.",
    "What do you think we should do next?",
    "I think we need to add a level of safety to it first. I do not want to be responsible for any pain or loss here.",
    "We could try it for sure. I gave the last of it to your dad to hold.",
    "I guess we'll have to look around for something else then.",
    "What do you think we should do next?",
    "We're going to slide it.",
    "Why am I silly?",
    "The feet?",
    "It's a sled, it slides.",
    "Okay, i'll find suitable 'feet' for the sled.[sic]",
    "What do you think we should do next?",
    "Do you suppose you've got any fireflies left in the jar?",
    "Why did I even ask? I'll go find a light.",
    "What do you think we should do next? I've found a lantern but no fuel.",
    "I guess so!",
    "What do you think we should do next? It's time to give the sled a name.",
    "I wouldn't have it any other way.",
    "How about [sled name]?",
    "Should we add the racing stripes now?",
    "It's time we set off for Yeti Town.",
    "Are you ready?",
    "I should talk to Violet.",
    "This looks like a good place to build a sled. How does this look?",
    "Exactly, a perfectly flat, super and open area.",
    "Next we need to find a suitable material to build the sled with.",
    "Next we need to find a suitable material to build the sled with.",
    "Who needs instructions?",
    "Hmmmm",
    "Pretty sure that is right?",
    "Nope that looks wrong...",
    "Okay maybe instructions are needed...",
    "Perfect!",
    "Next we need to find something to bind the sled together with.",
    "A bit of rope here",
    "A bit of rope there",
    "That seems quite tight",
    "Feeling sturdy!",
    "Perfect!",
    "Next we need to find something to help the sled slide.",
    "Next we need to find something to help the sled slide.",
    "A perfect fit!",
    "This is a little wonky",
    "If I just bend that... and then turn that...",
    "Oh, I am good!",
    "If that fits into place just there... and...",
    "Done!",
    "Next we need to find a light that will help keep the way lit.",
    "Next we need to find a light that will help keep the way lit.",
    "Looks great!",
    "Next we need to find some fuel to keep that lantern lit.",
    "Next we need to find some fuel to keep that lantern lit.",
    "This little light of mine",
    "I'm gonna let it shine!",
    "Looks like this sled is finished and what a beauty it is!",
    "I should talk to Violet.",
    "Maybe this old barrel will do? All the wood has rotted away leaving only the metal fasteners.",
    "In that case, why didn't we just keep the barrel from earlier and do that?",
    "Such a dad joke.",
    "I've already got this item.",
    "I should talk to Violet.",
    "This looks like it'd work as a base for a sled!",
    "TIMBBBBEERRRRR",

    "You're right. This will be our little secret.",
    "Nothing to see here.",
    "Oh that's where I left it! Next time I won't be so careless.",
    "I should talk to Violet.",
    "A rope. It's a little wet but seems sturdy enough to use as bindings for the sled.",
    "I've already got this item.",
    "I should talk to Violet.",

    "We will indeed. Thanks for the kind offer, [Player].",
    "Humans, you say? They are tasty, that's what they are! GET 'EM IN THE COOKING POT!",
    "We can also do humour! The look on your face though!",
    "Bless you! You'd better not catch a cold again, make sure you're all wrapped up warm. No taking your gloves off. Even if you're feeling too hot, it's better to keep the warm layers on.",
    "Before you all go off, please warm up with some freshly made stew.",
    "What did you have?"

  "Trevor": [
    "Are you causing trouble? Did you go beyond the gate?",
    "But you know better than to run off without us with you! What have we told you?",
    "Would you give us a minute or two to talk with this adventurer here?",
    "Don't call me later, call me Dad.",
    "If you change your mind in the future, we'll be right here, won't we deary?",
    "Brilliant observation. You must be a furless yeti.",
    "It was sarcasm, we know what humans are!",
    "I'll be coming with you, I know the path well.",
    "I'm a yeti, all I need for going outside is the wind in my face and snow between my toes.",
    "No, I don't think they'll fit me.",
    "I've got this empty jar.",
    "What for?",
    "That sounds reasonable! Here you go!",
    "I've already given you my jar.",
    "I just coughed up what looks like a furball?",
    "Nope, you should take a look around to see if there is anything that will help light the way.",
    "You'll need to create a spile.",
    "It's a tree tap and usually crafted from metal or wood, if you find some logs I'm sure you're skilled enough of a fletcher to create such an item.",
    "You've already got one right there it seems and it's made from maple logs. A maple spile, getting maple from a maple tree! Give it a tap, a shimmy and then push it into a tree to release its syrupy juices.",
    "That's great! Now what are you going to do with it?",
    "Right this way.",
    "This is why we can't have nice things.",
    "Did you know, the maple tree secretes a sugary syrup that tastes delicious. The syrup is also incredibly useful as it's sticky like glue.",
    "It's common knowledge.",
    "What's brown and sticky?",
    "A stick.",
    "Don't chop all of the tree! You're going to ruin all the tasty maple!",
    "That was cheeky, Violet.",
    "...",
    "We've already got one little horror running about the house! How do you think we'll be able to handle two![sic]",
    "My old bones can't take all this adventure anymore. But in answer to your question; yes, I am having a whale of a time.",
    "That was really fun to watch! Violet is going to be quite the dead shot when she grows up.",
    "You can't be tired already? I thought you said you were some kind of great adventurer?",
    "You're right. If we try to cross that now, we'll go straight through.",
    "This IS the only way.",
    "I'm old, not stupid.",
    "Why don't you leave this to me? Get ready for the best roar you've ever heard!",
    "Is the ice safe to cross yet?",
    "I'm sure if you look around you can find everything you need.",
    "You really are resourceful aren't you?",
    "I have no doubt. So, what next?",
    "Why are you looking at me like that?",
    "I don't bend that way!",
    "My bones...",
    "...what are you doing to me?",
    "Don't you worry about me! Look out! Here I come!",
    "Ow, my bones...",
    "It's lovely to see how excited she is.",
    "I don't think my bones will be able to take both of you.",
    "I wasn't going to eat it, I was just going taste it.[sic]",
    "If that barrel was complete, we could have just slid Violet down in it and walked down ourselves.",
    "That would be forward thinking and seeing you struggle is... ...wait for it...[sic] ...a barrel of laughs.",
    "If you just turn it upside down. Nobody will know.[sic]",
    "Of course! Be safe and play nice!",
    "Look at her face! She's so happy!",
    "I agree. Thank you for all your help. Are you planning on sticking round for the festival?",
    "That's the spirit! I knew there was some yeti in you!",
    "You adventurers... always on the run. Let an old yeti give you some advice.",
    "Slow down and appreciate what's around you. There's so much in the world you may be missing; in your rush to see and do everything, are you really present to enjoy what is in front of you?",
    "Violet... how she came into our lives was such a surprise. But she was the best thing to happen to us!",
    "Betty and I are happier than we've ever been now we're a family."

  "Trevor/Betty": [
    "Calm down, we haven't captured her at all.",
    "Violet is an orphan. We found her on our doorstep in a basket wrapped up in a blanket.",
    "We've raised her. Held her hand through her first steps. Kissed her knees when she fell over and we've fought away the monsters that hide under her bed. We know she isn't like normal yeti children, which is why we're afraid of taking her to the festival. I worry that she won't be accepted. The longer we leave it, I worry the worse she is going to get. She already runs off beyond the gates and we're too old to keep her from doing so now. It is only a matter of time. We want to give her the most magical childhood before she grows up but have never been able to. We're worried about it. What if she's picked on or made fun of.[sic]",
    "There is a village nearby, just over the mountain pass, where all yeti gather to celebrate. It's somewhat a rite of passage for all yeti kind. But Violet isn't a yeti. I worry she won't be accepted by the others. We've always wanted to take her to the festival.",
    "The question is more for you, are you willing to help Violet have a magical adventure?",
    "Thank you. You should probably tell her the good news.",
    "It's a festival where all yetis gather together to celebrate.",
    "Nothing, just to celebrate.",
    "No, but you can take my word for it - it's the most magical thing a yeti can experience.",
    "Have you told Violet we're going to the festival?",
    "What are you waiting for?",
    "Well, please don't forget to make the adventure as magical for Violet as for yourself.",
    "You're the kind adventurer who is willing to help us. It should be you.",
    "I see you've been roped into I-spy.",
    "It's a good way of getting Violet to tidy up. We say an item, she goes and gets it, and then we ask her to put it where it lives. The foolproof way of getting a six year old to tidy her room!",
