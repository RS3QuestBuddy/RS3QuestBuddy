  "King Narnode Shareen": [
    "Welcome Traveller. I am King Narnode. It's nice to see an outsider.",
    "For now.",
    "Traveller, can I speak to you in strictest confidence?",
    "Not here, follow me.",
    "Down here.",
    "These, my friend, are the foundations of the stronghold.",
    "Not just any roots Traveller! These were created by gnome mages eons ago, since then they have grown to become a mighty stronghold!",
    "In the last two months our tree guardians have reported continuing deterioration of the Grand Tree's health. I've never seen this before! It could be the end for us all!",
    "In effect yes. Would you be willing to help us discover what is happening to the tree?",
    "I understand Traveller. Please keep this to yourself.",
    "I'll show you the way back up.",
    "Up here.",
    "Thank Guthix for your arrival! The first task is to find out what's killing the tree.",
    "My top tree guardian, Glough, believes it's human sabotage. I'm not so sure! The only way to know for sure is to talk to Hazelmere.",
    "Hazelmere is one of the mages that created the Grand Tree! He is the only one that has survived from that time. Take this bark sample to him, he will be able to help!",
    "The mage only talks in the old tongue, you'll need this.",
    "It's a translation book, you'll need it to translate what Hazelmere says. Do this carefully! His words are our only hope! You'll find his dwellings high upon a towering hill, on an island east of Yanille. Please make haste.",
    "Up here.",
    "Enjoy your stay with us. There are many things to see in my kingdom.",
    "Traveler, any word from Hazelmere?",
    "Here's another sample, hang on to it this time!",
    "Don't worry, I have more.",
    "Hazelmere lives on an island just south of the Khazard Fight Arena. Give him the sample and translate his reply. I just hope he can help us in our hour of need!",
    "Hello Traveller, did you speak to Hazelmere?",
    "Do you understand what he said?",
    "So what did he say?",
    "Wait a minute, that doesn't sound like Hazelmere! Are you sure you translated correctly?",
    "I'm sorry Traveller but this is no good. The translation must be perfect or the infomation's no use. Please come back when you know exactly what Hazelmere said.",
    "Of course! I should've known! Someone must've forged my royal seal. Hazelmere thought I sent him for the Daconia stones!",
    "Hazelmere created the Daconia stones. They are a safety measure, in case the tree grew out of control. They're the only thing that can kill the tree. This is terrible! The stones must be recovered!",
    "First I must warn the tree guardians. Please, could you tell the chief tree guardian Glough. He lives in a tree house just in front of the Grand Tree. If he's not there he will be at his girlfriend Anita's place. Meet me back here once you've told him.",
    "Here's another sample, hang on to it this time!",
    "Time is of the essence Traveller!",
    "Hello Traveller, did you speak to Glough?",
    "OK. He lives just in front of the Grand Tree. Let me know when you've talked to him.",
    "It's OK Traveller, thanks to Glough! He found a human sneaking around! He had three Daconia rocks on him!",
    "Yes Glough really knows what he's doing. The human has been detained until we know who else is involved. Maybe Glough was right, maybe humans are invading!",
    "Certainly. He's on the top level of the tree. Be careful, it's a long way down!",
    "Hello Traveller. If you wish to talk to the prisoner go to the top of the tree, you'll find him there.",
    "Hello Traveller. So, did you speak to the culprit?",
    "What do you mean?",
    "That's absurd! He's just trying to save himself! Since Glough's wife died he's been a little strange. He would never wrongly imprison someone though! Now that the culprit is locked up we can relax. It's sad but I think Glough was right. Humans are planning to invade and wipe out the tree gnomes!",
    "Who knows? You may have to leave soon Traveller! I trust you but the local gnomes are getting paranoid.",
    "Why? Don't worry about him now the culprit has been caught. I'm sure Glough's resentment of humans will pas with time.",
    "If you're really concerned speak to him.",
    "Traveller please accept my apologies! Glough had no right to arrest you! I just think he's scared of humans. Let me get you out of there.",
    "I know he can be a bit extreme at times. But he's the best tree guardian I have, he has made the gnomes paranoid about humans though. I'm afraid Glough has placed guards on the front gate to stop you escaping! Let my glider pilot fly you away until things calm down around here.",
    "I'm sorry again Traveller!",
    "Glough is looking for you! Leave on the glider now before it's too late!",
    "Traveller, what are you doing here? The stronghold has been put on full alert! It's not safe for you here!",
    "That's an absurd accusation!",
    "That's enough Traveller, you sound as paranoid as him! Traveller please leave! It's bad enough having one human locked up.",
    "Please Traveller, if the gnomes see me talking to you they'll revolt against me.",
    "Glough's scared the whole town, he expects the humans to attack any day. He's even begun to recruit hundreds of gnome soldiers.",
    "Please Traveller, leave before it's too late!",
    "Look, if you're right about Glough I would have him arrested but there's no reason for me to think he's lying.",
    "If these are to be believed then this is terrible! But it's not proof, any one could have made these. Traveller, I understand your concern, I had guards search Glough's house but they found nothing suspicious, just these odd twigs.",
    "On the other hand, if Glough's right about the humans we will need an army of gnomes to protect ourselves. So I've decided to allow Glough to raise a mighty gnome army. The Grand Tree's still slowly dying, if it is human sabotage we must respond!",
    "Please Traveller, take my advice and leave!",
    "Traveller you're wounded! What happened?",
    "What?! Glough?! With a demon?!",
    "Never! Not Glough! He's a good gnome at heart!",
    "Guard!",
    "Go and check out that passage!",
    "I..I don't know what to say! How could I have been so blind?! Guard! Call off the military training! The humans are not attacking!",
    "You have my full apologies Traveller! And my gratitude! A reward will have to wait though, the tree is still dying! The guards are clearing Glough's rock supply now but there must be more Daconia hidden somewhere in the roots! Help us search, we have little time!",
    "Traveller, have you managed to find the Daconia?",
    "The tree will still die if we don't find it! It could be anywhere!",
    "Traveller, have you managed to find the Daconia?",
    "Yes! Excellent, well done!",
    "It's incredible, the tree's health is improving already! I don't know what to say, we owe you so much! To think Glough had me fooled all along!",
    "I'll drink to that! From now on I vow to make this stronghold a welcoming place for all! I'll grant you access to all our facilities.",
    "It should make your stay here easier. You can use the spirit tree to transport yourself, as well as the gnome glider. I also give you access to our mine.",
    "Very few know of the secret mine under the Grand Tree. If you push on the roots just to my north they will separate and let you pass.",
    "That's magic trees for you! All the best Traveller and thanks again!",
    "Well, hello again Traveller! How are you?",
    "Better than ever, thanks to you!"

    "Impressive. What exactly is the problem?",

    "Grave danger lies ahead, only the bravest will linger.",
    "Time is of the essence! We must move quickly.",
    "There is no need for haste.",
    "A man came to me with the King's seal.",
    "You must act now or we will all die!",
    "Time passes us by.",
    "I gave the man Daconia rocks.",

    "Never!",
    "Hello, Your Highness. Have you any news on the Daconia stones?",
    "Wow! That was quick!",
    "I doubt it, can I speak to the prisoner?",
    "Thanks.",
    "Tell me. Why would you want to kill the Grand Tree?",
    "Don't tell me, you just happened to be caught carrying Daconia rocks!",
    "I don't understand.",

    "OK. Thanks Charlie.",
    "Hello Charlie.",
    "No idea.",
    "Yes I did and something's not right!",

    "What do you mean?",
    "Surely not!",
    "Your Highness! I'm concerned about Glough!",
    "I'm not so sure.",
    "Glough! I don't know what you're up to but I know you paid Charlie to get those rocks!",
    "I know the Grand Tree's dying! And I think you're part of the reason.",
    "It's Glough! He's trying to cover something up.",
    "Why?",
    "Thanks Charlie!",
    "I don't think you can trust Glough, Your Highness. He seems to have an unnatural hatred for humans.",
    "Well, OK.",
    "I can't figure this out Charlie!",

You'll find him in the Karamja Shipyard, east of Shilo village. Be careful! If he discovers you're not working for Glough there'll be trouble! The sea men use the password Ka-Lu-Min.",
