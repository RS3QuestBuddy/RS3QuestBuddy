    "Tell me about this antiques business.",
    "Is there anything else interesting to do around here?",
    "Nothing. I was just wondering if there was anything else to do?",
    "You want me to do you a favour?",
    "An adventurer of my calibre, isn't that overkill.",
    "What are you going to give me if I do it?",
    "Nah thanks, I've got bigger fish to fry.",
    "Okay, see you in a tick!",
    "I'll get going then!",
    "Where do I meet this jungle forester?",
    "Hmm, sorry, not interested.",
    "What was I supposed to do again?",
    "I've forgotten what to do, can you remind me",
    "This is taking longer than I expected!",
    "Is there an easier way of getting this exotic wood?",
    "Everyone is asking me to do them favours now! It seems like I've opened the floodgates!",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "I need to talk to you about red mahogany.",
    "Ok, I'll take your hatchet to get it sharpened.",
    "Why should I take it to Captain Shanks?",
    "Where is Captain Shanks?",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "What did you want me to do again?",
    "Oh, yes... Ok! No, I'm sure that nothing bad has happened to it, I mean, you gave it to me, I'm really dependable!",
    "What am I supposed to do again?",
    "Who is it that I'm supposed to meet?",
    "Do you really actually need that hatchet?",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "I've lost your unsharpened hatchet, I need a new one.",
    "Ok, I promiste to be more careful.",
    "Actually I have a favour to ask.",
    "I have a hatchet from the jungle forester, I wonder if you could nip into Brian's Axes in Port Sarim and get it sharpened for the jungle forester.",
    "But... I was only meant to do a small favour for Yanni Salika... I don't want to go to Port Sarim!",
    "Actually I have a favour to ask.",
    "Do you sharpen hatchets?",
    "But... what?",
    "It sound serious!",
    "Look, can you sharpen this cursed hatchet or what?",
    "Oh, so you want a favour doing as well?",
    "What?",
    "Is there anyone else who can sharpen this hatchet?",
    "Ok, ok, I'll do it! I'll go and see Aggie. [Once Brian has asked for a favour]",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "You know what! You're absolutely right! I must have dropped it or left it somewhere.",
    "What did you want me to do again?",
    "Oh, right, yes, sorry, I forgot..",
    "Could I ask you about being a character witness?",
    "'Jimmy the Chisel' \u2013 what kind of name is that?",
    "What do you mean missing?",
    "Do you have any idea where he might be?",
    "Let me guess, you're going to ask me to do you a favour?",
    "Hmm, I seem to have heard that one before. Go on then, what do you want me to do?",
    "No way... I've had enough of doing favours for people.",
    "Oh. Ok, I'll see if I can find Jimmy.",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "Hey who are you?",
    "I'm Player, and I've come to release you...Aggie sent me.",
    "Well, I thought I'd try a more diplomatic solution first...do you know who I have to talk to?",
    "Ok, I'll try that.",
    "I'm looking for Jimmy the Chisel.",
    "Huh. It sounds like you're forcing him to join you!",
    "Well, I have to return him to his employer, she's very worried about him, so if you could just hand him over... I'll be getting out of your way.",
    "And I suppose you need me to do you a favour?",
    "Ok, just exactly what is it that you want me to do?",
    "No way... go do your own dirty work!",
    "Ok, Jimmy has to be worth more than a few scrawny chickens!",
    "I'm back.",
    "What did you want me to do again?",
    "Can't you just release Jimmy the Chisel?",
    "Err...not exactly!",
    "I don't think I can do this.",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "Hiya...you're Jimmy aren't you?",
    "I've made a deal with Johanhus...I need to go sort out some chickens to secure your release.",
    "Yeah...me too...anyway, I'll be back as soon as I've got the deal sorted.",
    "I need to talk to you about Jimmy.",
    "He's being kept prisoner by a bunch of fanatics and I need to organise a delivery of a month's supply of chickens to secure his release.",
    "Yes, it's pretty bad... but keep calm, I'm going to help.",
    "None at all?",
    "Well, can't you just give me some chickens?",
    "Well, do you know someone who does have a month's supply?",
    "What did you suggest I do again?",
    "Ok, I'll go and see him then.",
    "Sorry for the intrusion, but this is quite urgent. Jimmy the Chisel is being held by fanatics. They won't release him until they get a month's supply of chickens.",
    "I've already talked to Fred but he says he doesn't have a month's supply of chickens. Is there any way that you could help?",
    "That's exactly what I said...",
    "What do you propose?",
    "I had a feeling you might!",
    "No way, I'm fed up with this wild goose chase!",
    "Oh, ok! I guess it's not that much further to Varrock!",
    "What am I meant to be doing again?",
    "Ah yes...I remember now.",
    "I'm back from talking to Seth!",
    "He said he would help us...I have to go to Varrock to get some chicken cages made up!",
    "Hi, I need to talk to you about chicken cages! Seth Groats has asked me to come and see you!",
    "But I don't have three steel bars at the moment!",
    "Ok, well I have three steel bars here, you can have these.",
    "Oh dear, you don't sound too well?",
    "Well that's a shame because I really need your help to make some chicken cages!",
    "Oh, I see, you need me to do you a favour?",
    "Oh, no not another favour, I just can't do another one!",
    "Ok, I guess one good turn deserves another.",
    "Well, hopefully, I'll be right back, but you never know. It might take longer!",
    "What was I supposed to be doing?",
    "I am the Apothecary. I have potions to brew. Do you need anything specific?",
    "Horvik is ill. I need breathing salts and herbal tincture.",
    "Wow that was surprisingly easy! Fantastic, thanks very much.",
    "Oh... but... what about the breathing salts...",
    "Ok...",
    "That's ok, just hand over the breathing salts.",
    "I just knew this wasn't going to be easy! So you can't get any more breathing salts?",
    "Where would you get one of those from?",
    "Where could I do that?",
    "Oh, no way am I going to the Barbarian Village!",
    "Oh, ok, I guess it's not that far to the Barbarian Village.",
    "Horvik is ill, I need breathing salts.",
    "Oh yes... where am I going to get a new pot?",
    "What was I supposed to be doing again?",
    "Oh, yes right!",
    "I've lost that herbal tincture you gave me!",
    "Hey there... I need an air tight pot just as soon as you can make one!",
    "It's a matter of some urgency that I have an airtight container just as soon as possible!",
    "Oh, sorry, I didn't think... what's the problem?",
    "Loan shark? Hammerspike? What are you talking about?",
    "But I need an airtight pot... to store breathing salts in.",
    "Ok, I'll deal with Hammerspike!",
    "Yes, I'll go and have a chat with him, perhaps we can sort something out.",
    "That's not a pretty picture you're painting, but don't worry, I'll be careful. Now, where do I find this Hammerspike?",
    "No, sorry, no more blooming favours for anyone!",
    "Hey there...I'm back...",
    "Not exactly, can you tell me what I'm supposed to do again?",
    "I'm looking for Hammerspike.",
    "What're you doing here?",
    "Who do you work for?",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "I'm [Player] and I want to talk to you about a friend of mine, Tassie Slipcast. She says you're putting the screws on her for some loan she had from you. Is this true?",
    "Well, I've come to change the deal.",
    "Er... er... not exactly... why can't you just leave her alone? I mean, make a nice gesture, I'm asking you as a favour... please?",
    "Can't you just leave Tassie alone?",
    "Oh, come on... do something nice for Tassie.",
    "Oh, come on... do something nice for a Tassie. Think about how hard she's working!",
    "Yeah, come on give her a break.",
    "I can understand that... you have a lot on your mind. Go on, make a change... it'll do you good! There must be something else that you wanted to do at least once in your life.",
    "Have you always been a gangster?",
    "Have you always been a gangster? Wasn't there anything else that you wanted to do instead? Come on, tell me what you want to do... I'm listening.",
    "Ok, that sounds good.",
    "I don't think they take dwarven gangsters as initiates.",
    "Ok, another favour... I think I can manage that.",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "What was it that I was supposed to do for you?",
    "Are you taking any new initiates?",
    "How does someone become an initiate?",
    "Seems pretty straight forward!",
    "Do you accept dwarves?",
    "A dwarf I know wants to become an initiate.",
    "Not you as well?",
    "Well, that seems simple enough.",
    "Are you mad?",
    "I've been asked to do a lot of favours recently.",
    "Yep, it's a deal.",
    "Yep, it's a deal. Tell me the recipe for this potion.",
    "Mmm, sounds delicious! What's it called?",
    "Can I drink it?",
    "Great! And thanks.",
    "But I can drink it though.",
    "Ok, I think I understand.",
    "Nope, it's not a deal!",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "What did you need me to do again?",
    "Oh yes, right, thanks!",
    "How do i make the potion again?",
    "Ok yes, right, thanks.",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "Sanfew asked me to come and talk to you.",
    "I have a special potion here for you from Sanfew!",
    "Yes, he's quite considerate that way... you know, thinking of people. In fact, he was thinking that you may be able to help him with another little 'helping' situation that involves ogres.",
    "More like 'super-over-grown-gnomes' if you ask me! Or 'overgrown humans'!",
    "Sanfew wants to bring the word of Guthix to those ogres, though I've no idea if ogres have the mental ability to grasp druidic concepts.",
    "Well, he wants to know if he can organise a glider ride down there.",
    "Ok, good luck with that.",
    "TRASH? What the devil are you talking about? Why do I have to get it?",
    "What do you want me to do?",
    "What is T.R.A.S.H?",
    "Where can I get this from?",
    "Great! So I get to talk T.R.A.S.H with shopkeepers!",
    "Ok, I'll go and get you some T.R.A.S.H.",
    "No, sorry, I can't do it right now.",
    "How was that potion?",
    "What am I supposed to be doing again?",
    "I need to talk T.R.A.S.H to you.",
    "Yes, of course. There's a Gnome on White Wolf mountain who needs some T.R.A.S.H... for his glider... do you have some?",
    "Well, I'm sort of doing him a favour.",
    "How totally unpredictable!",
    "Yeah, I've heard of that before! Go on... tell me anyway.",
    "Well, I can understand that.",
    "Yes. Ok, I'll do it!",
    "No way... I've had enough of this wild goose chase.",
    "What did you want me to do again?",
    "Hi, can you give me a weather forecast?",
    "Great! So can I assume you've been really pro-active and compiled an up-to-date one for me?",
    "So, in your case, you have the power of foresight, but you're too lazy to act on it?",
    "Who is this girl that you're concerned about?",
    "Where is this girl?",
    "Do you have any ideas where that might be? I mean, it's pretty vague isn't it?",
    "What do you think needs to be done?",
    "I'm sorry but I can't help.",
    "What can I do to help?",
    "So, let me get this right. You want me to start poking my nose into a lot of caves where some creatures might be?",
    "Risking my neck for some tomboy who thinks she's got what it takes to be a real adventurer?",
    "Yes. Ok, I'll do it.",
    "No, sorry, I can't do it right now. Or maybe ever!",
    "What did you need me to do again?",
    "I need you to start checking nearby caves looking for our missing Petra. The caves are probably home to some creature or creatures. Check around the vicincity[sic]. The impressions are coming from a south westerly direction. Don't go further east than you are already, no further south than Ardougne and no further west than the combat training camp.",
    "I need to talk to you about a girl stuck in some rock!",
    "Hey! Not so fast! I've seen a young girl encased in rock, a note in her belt led me to you.",
    "What the demonikin are you talking about?",
    "No way am I going to Port Khazard for you!",
    "Oh! Ok, one more 'small favour' isn't going to kill me... I hope!",
    "What? Are you saying I have to travel a thousand miles?",
    "What did you want me to do again?",
    "Hello there. Wizard Cromperty sent me to get some iron oxide, do you have some?",
    "Rust? What do you mean? How much does it cost?",
    "Groan!!",
    "So, let me get this straight.",
    "You want me to traipse ALL the way down past the ogre city with some flea infested mattress, to some hermit ogre who can't shoot a chompy bird to save his life, so that you'll give me a pot of rust?",
    "Ok, I'll do it!",
    "Sorry, I just don't want to do it.",
    "Erm, what was I supposed to be doing again?",
    "Erm, I've lost the mattress... do you have another one I can get refilled?",
    "Ok, here's 100 coins for another mattress...",
    "I'm not paying you 100 coins for that stinky mattress.",
    "Ok, then I won't.",
    "Great!",
    "GLADLY!",
    "I need to talk to you about a mattress!",
    "Can you fill this mattress with feathers?",
    "What's going on around here?",
    "What can I do about that?",
    "Ok, I'll see what I can do.",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "What did you want me to do again?",
    "Hello there, what are you working on?",
    "What purpose will that serve?",
    "Is there anything I can do?",
    "Rantz said I should come and help you finish this project.",
    "Yes, I'll take a look at them.",
    "We'll see!",
    "Sorry my friend, but I've got other things to attend to.",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "What was it you wanted me to do again?",
    "I need a new gem to fix the lights.",
    "Ok, here's 500 gold, I'll buy one.",
    "No way am I paying that much.",
    "I've fixed all the lights!",
    "I know one Ogre who'll be very pleased about that!",
    "Hey there, how's it going?",
    "Hey there, how's it going?",
    "Ok, I've helped that Gnome, he shouldn't bother you anymore.",
    "But I don't have the stodgy mattress anymore...I'll have to get another one.",
    "Great, I think Tindel will get a good night's rest on this.",
    "I've lost that filled mattress you gave me!",
    "Ok, I'll give you 200 bright pretties.",
    "No way am I giving you 200 bright pretties.",
    "I have the mattress!",
    "What should I do now?",
    "I've lost the iron oxide, can I have some more?",
    "Ok, I'll buy it.",
    "No way am I paying 200 coins for a bottle of rust!",
    "I have that iron oxide you asked for!",
    "What should I do now?",
    "I need another animate rock spell.",
    "No way...I'm cleaning up your mess, you should be grateful!",
    "Ok, here you go!",
    "Grrrrr!",
    "Um nahi listic duroo-rah!",
    "Whoa! That was a bit of a misfire.",
    "And this doesn't look good!",
    "Um nahi listic durooo-rah!",
    "Oh, not so long... I don't think...",
    "I mean... that is... I'm not so sure... at all... in fact.",
    "Well, actually, I think that some of the people at the Seers Village are worried about you. That's how I came to find you here. Phantuwti sent me.",
    "No problem... I'll probably see you back at the Seers Village.",
    "I've released Petra, she should have returned.",
    "So can I have the weather report now please?",
    "Listen you... just give me the blooming weather report!",
    "Why can't you get a clear picture?",
    "You're making me angry! I did you a favour, now pay up!",
    "Which special Seers tools do you mean?",
    "What do you mean, 'special combination of items'?",
    "You're talking about a weather vane aren't you?",
    "You can't predict the weather because your weather vane is broken... that's it isn't it? Holy Saradomin breath... you can't even predict the weather, you need a weather vane!",
    "Ok, show me where this weather vane is... I want to look at it.",
    "I may be able to fix it and then you can give me a weather report... come on, let's go!",
    "Just show me it!",
    "You're talking in riddles, just give me a straight answer!",
    "This isn't allegory though, you're just avoiding my questions!",
    "How hard can it be to predict the weather?",
    "Ok, what's it going to take to get a weather report?",
    "No, sorry, it doesn't help at all, I need a weather report and I need it now...so hand it over!",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "You're just a fake... you can't predict the weather!",
    "You should get out more!",
    "What's it going to take for you to give me that weather report?",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "I've done my part of the deal, now hand over that weather report.",
    "I'll run you through if you don't give me that weather report.",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "Hey, I'm fixing the weather vane!",
    "I've fixed the weather vane!",
    "Hi again, what should I do now?",
    "I've lost the weather report.",
    "Thanks!",
    "I have the weather report for you.",
    "Thanks!",
    "Hey there, did you get your T.R.A.S.H? Arhein said that he'd send one of his associates up with it.",
    "Ok then... thanks I will!",
    "Hi there! The Gnome Pilot has agreed to take you to see the ogres!",
    "Yep and with good news... your life is about to change for the better. I've persuaded Sanfew to take you in as an initiate!",
    "Ok, you promise me that you won't bother Tassie anymore and I'll leave you alone.",
    "I'll be ready for you whenever you want to take a shot Hammerspike... I'm not afraid of you! You're just a bully who can't fight his own battles.",
    "Hey there, Hammerspike won't be bothering you anymore!",
    "Well you could make me an airtight pot!",
    "Hey there! I have an air-tight pot for you!",
    "What should I do now?",
    "Oh yes, you're right!",
    "I've lost the breathing salts you gave me, can I have some more please?",
    "Hey there! I have an air-tight pot for you!",
    "Hey there! I have an air-tight pot for you!",
    "But I don't have an airtight pot.",
    "I have the tincture and the breathing salts.",
    "I have the five pigeon cages you asked for!",
    "Here they are! I've got all five!",
    "I have some chicken cages!",
    "Don't worry about Jimmy. His release is imminent!",
    "You're in luck, I've managed to swing that chicken deal for you.",
    "Thanks for the offer, but I'm sort of in the middle of something currently.",
    "Hold on! Aren't you forgetting something?",
    "You said that you would release Jimmy! Are you going to keep your word or am I going to have to get angry?",
    "Good... I have things to do and I've had enough of people messing me about.",
    "Very well...but if you're lying, I'll be back and I won't be happy!",
    "Good news! Jimmy has been released by those fanatical HAM people! He said he was on his way back here!",
    "I've returned with good news. Aggie has agreed to be your character witness!",
    "What's that?",
    "Well... what's going to happen now?",
    "You have got to be kidding!",
    "Hey, how's it going?",
    "I've lost that sharpened hatchet you gave me? Can I get another one please?",
    "Good news, I have your sharpened hatchet!",
    "Yep, here it is... at long last!",
    "Why you ungrateful...",
    "Hi again, thanks for the red mahogany.",
    "I've lost that red mahogany you gave me!",
    "But I do not have 200 gold!",
    "Ok, here's 200 gold for some red mahogany.",
    "I won't pay you 200 gold for a piece of wood!",
    "Here's the red mahogany you asked for.",
    "Wait, that's it?",
    "What! I've traipsed halfway around Gielinor...",
    "I've negotiated with fanatics, dwarven gangsters and arrogant gnomes.",
    "I've fixed ancient weather vanes and gnomish landing lights and fought supernatural rock monsters...",
    "I've filled stodgy mattresses with feathers, made pot lids to help cure an ailing metal-smith... and that's all the thanks I get? Thanks!",
    "Raarrrhhhh!",
    "What is it?",
    "A key ring? That's it?",
    "Groan! Yeah, so did everyone else!"

  "Yanni Salika": [
    "You sound a bit bored of Shilo Village... what's wrong?",
    "Well, if you're bored, you could do me a small favour and nip to see the jungle forester. I need a piece of red mahogany to resurface an antique wardrobe.",
    "Well, if you've got nothing better to do... I mean, you looked bored.",
    "Cooolll! Sorry your most amazingness, didn't realise you were too above it all to do someone a favour!",
    "Give you? I don't think you heard me... I asked for a favour! It means that I'll 'owe you one' when you need something doing. That's what a favour is!",
    "Fair enough! Hope it all goes well... but, you know, you looked bored so I just thought I'd suggest it.",
    "Great, nice of you to do it for me.",
    "That'd be helpful!",
    "Oh, sorry, I thought you knew the area. You'll find a jungle forester in between the southern edge of Shilo Village and the Kharazi Jungle.",
    "They're always trying to find ways into that place.",
    "I hear that some old timer from the Legends Guild keeps sending new recruits down there... only Zamorak knows why.",
    "What do you mean?",
    "Tsk... It's only a little job bwana, I ask you to do me one small favour! Go to the jungle forester and get me a piece of red mahogany. It can't be that difficult can it?",
    "You're telling me bwana, I was supposed to have this wardrobe finished before now! Hurry it up will you, I don't have all day!",
    "Huh! You make it sound like a major undertaking! I should ahve just done it myself!",
    "Well, can't you just do my favour and forget about theirs?",
    "Well, that's absolutely wonderful my friend! Many thanks!",
    "Well... what were you expecting? I mean, it took you so long I could have gone and got it myself!",
    "Well, you didn't have to go to so much trouble...",
    "Look, I can see that you're quite upset about this... so here, have this.",
    "It's a key ring, you can store some of your most valuable keys on it... helps to keep things organised! It goes on your toolbelt!",
    "Well, I only asked you to do me one small favour...",
    "Oh... ok, I guess I could offer you these lamps... I'm not sure what they're worth, but you can have them."
  ],
  "Jungle forester": [
    "Oh, yes, well I can get you a piece but I need my hatchet sharpening... Do me a small favour would you and take it to Captain Shanks for me won't you?",
    "Great, here you go! If you could ask the Captain to pop it into Brian's Axes for resharpening when he's next in Port Sarim, that would be really helpful.",
    "He's the Captain of the 'Lady of the Waves', he goes to Port Sarim quite often. Could you ask the Captain to drop the hatchet in at Brian's Axes the next time he's in Port Sarim? I'm sure he won't mind!",
    "Wow, you're really not from around here are you? The Captain is to the west of here, follow the northern edge of the Kharazi Jungle, he's usually on board his ship!",
    "I gave you my blunt hatchet to give to Captain Shanks. I was hoping that he would be able to pop into Brian's Axes in Port Sarim to get it sharpened. I do hope nothing bad has happened to my hatchet, I am very partial to it!",
    "Take the blunt hatchet to Captain Shanks and ask him to take it to Brian's Axes.",
    "Well, yes, actually. It's my favourite! I've been training with that hatchet since I started my profession as a jungle forester.",
    "I know, another jungle forester found it and returned it to me. Here, take it again and this time don't lose it!",
    "Ah Great!",
    "Yeah, you've been a while... I mean, I could have just gone and done it myself! It probably wouldn't have taken so long.",
    "Hang on a minute... there's no need to get so angry... here's that red mahogany you wanted.",

    "Don't go further east than you are already, no further south than Ardougne and no further west than the combat training camp.",
    "Well, I wouldn't have put it quite that way...",
    "Great! I just knew you'd agree to help!",
    "I knew you wouldn't help...oh well, perhaps some day you'll surprise me.",
    "Hi there, yes she has actually! Well done, you're a true hero!",
    "I wish I could but it's just been so difficult to get a clear image of the future at the moment. You know... we're all so relieved that Petra has returned and all that.",
    "Er... no, I can't, I told you, I can't get a clear picture. Nope, sorry, the conditions are just not quite right.",
    "Well, it's complicated, the special Seers tools that help us predict the weather are not aligned properly...",
    "I'm not making you angry, you're doing that all on your own! I just don't have a weather report to give you!",
    "I can't help that, you should be more understanding and less forceful, then I might be persuaded to give you the weather report.",
    "Well, we use a special combination of items which are used to gauge current weather movements and we're able to predict future weather patterns from these. Of course, it's strongly linked to the Seers' foresight ability.",
    "Well, let me think now... There's a copper eye, a rotating thing, and some pointy direction thingies. It's all highly scientific \u2013 and of course mystical \u2013 in a very magical 'foresight' sort of way.",
    "Er... maybe... I may be talking about that...",
    "Erm, well... err...",
    "What for?",
    "Oh, very well... but you'll need to be a specialist to fix this weather vane, it was made by some of the most experienced...",
    "Ok, ok, it's up on the roof...",
    "Since when has any Seer ever given you a straight answer... the power of knowing the future and the visions we see have to be wrapped in allegory so that the truth can slowly be accepted by the listener.",
    "How can you be sure? Are you so sure of what you just asked me? And am I really avoiding your questions by asking you lots of other questions? Answer me that huh!",
    "Anyway, we need a special combination of items before we can truly have foreknowledge of the weather.",
    "Quite hard actually. I mean, you're still waiting for me to do it aren't you and I've told you time and again that I can't... right now... but that normally it's actually quite an easy thing for me to do.",
    "Hmm, well, you can come back in several months and see if we can do one for you...does that help?",
    "Why... how dare you... I've never been so insulted in my life.",
    "Well, nothing in fact, as I can't give you a weather report. I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.",
    "I would really like to, please believe me, I would, but I just can't.",
    "Well, that's not very nice... I mean, I'm a nice guy and I thought you were nice too! Why would you want to run me through? I mean, it's only a weather report.",
    "It doesn't make sense to get angry about something so trivial.",
    "Fantastic, come and let me know when you've finished.",
    "Oh, thanks so much... you can't believe how helpful it is to get accurate predictions on the weather... we Seers are almost blind without it.",
    "There you go... a weather report as asked for... I hope it helps you!",
    "I've no clue my friend, you mentioned something about Arhein, but your plans might ahve changed in the meantime.",
    "Well, I knew you were going to say that! Here you go...have another one!"

  "Wizard Cromperty": [
    "Eh!",

    "Oh dear, it's such a bother getting them back out of the rock walls and I do loathe the trip to Port Khazard for the components.",
    "Well, it's not the first time someone's been teleported into a rock face, just the slightest miscalculation and bang... they're in the wall!",
    "It's fairly straightforward to cast a spell and fish them out again \u2013 but it requires a spell component from a chap in Port Khazard.",
    "I don't suppose you could do me a small favour could you?",
    "Just one small favour? Pop along to Port Khazard and get some iron oxide, it's a component of the spell.",
    "Oh dear, what a shame...I just don't have time to deal with this now...she's safe where she is for now, and I'm sure I'll get to it sooner or later.",
    "Waaahaaay! Great! I'd never suspect you'd be so helpful!",
    "You need to talk to a chap called Tindel Merchant in Port Khazard, he's sort of like an antiques dealer.",
    "Well, off you go then! A journey of a thousand miles starts with the first step and all that!",
    "Of course not... you silly... just... you know... the sooner you start the sooner you can get back... that's all I was saying.",
    "Go to Port Khazard and get me some iron oxide from Tindel Marchant.",
    "Great! Just what I needed! Now I need to give you a spell scroll to help bring Petra back again.",
    "Just cast this in the room, it should have her out of that rock in a jiffy! Good luck with your exploits... now, where was I with that wranklin severance device...",
    "Well, I thought you were going to use that spell I gave you to free Petra from the rock face?",
    "I suspected that you might...you can have one, but it will cost you 100 gold pieces.",
    "Well, I did give you the last one for free...you're not getting another one for free, even if it is my mess that you're trying to clear up! You shouldn't be so careless to leave things lying around!",
    "Thanks...try not to lose it this time."

  "Tindel Merchant": [
    "As a matter of fact, I do! However, it's the last in stock and I'm not likely to get more for a while so it's highly prized amongst the wizards at the moment.",
    "It's not easy to get so much rust together, even if I do come across it more often than most people with cleaning these rusty swords up!",
    "Yes, iron oxide is more commonly referred to as rust. As for a price, hmmm... well... let me think now... I could give it to you for the price of...",
    "One small favour!",
    "I need a nice mattress to sleep on! I haven't had a decent night's sleep in an ice-age... could you take this stodgy mattress down to Rantz in the ogre area and ask him to fill it with prime chompy bird feathers please?",
    "Well, er, I wouldn't have said it quite that way...",
    "Great, many thanks indeed! Here's the mattress!",
    "Well, that's a shame, but come back and see me if you change your mind.",
    "Take that stodgy mattress down to Rantz the ogre and get him to stuff it with prime chompy bird feathers. I want it to be the most luxurious mattress in the whole of Gielinor. I work so hard, I need a good night's sleep! You wouldn't believe some of the shoddy stuff some people try to palm off onto me! I have to be sharp to catch them out and make sure I can make a living.",
    "Yes, but I had to pay for this myself so you'd better pay me for losing my last one...it cost 100 gold!",
    "Ok, thanks a lot, here's the mattress!",
    "Well, don't expect your iron oxide any time soon then!",
    "Good!",
    "Get out!",
    "Grrrr!",
    "Great! Let's have a look then.",
    "Great! Here's the iron oxide I promised you!",
    "Didn't you need to take that bottle of rust to someone?",
    "Ok, but I'm going to have to charge you I'm afraid, 200 coins.",
