    "Oh, I remember you. You're the one that discovered Lord Sinclair's murderer. Well, I can tell you, strange things are afoot once again.",
    "Well, you didn't hear it from me, but I've heard the Sinclair family have vamoosed! Just up and left the mansion.",
    "Of course not! Anna's safely locked in the Seers' Village jail. She'll be going to trial soon, so I've heard.",
    "Yes, the guards received evidence from one of the family members that conclusively proved Anna did it. All other evidence was thrown out, it was that good. So they arrested her and soon the case will go to court.",
    "Well, it wouldn't be suspicious at all, but King Arthur has also disappeared. No one has seen him or the knights in quite a while. Quite a coincidence, don't you think?",
    "You didn't hear it from me, but I believe that guard in the garden is also investigating it. He might be able to tell you more.",
    "Ah, too bad. I'll have to get news from my other sources.",
    "Their history? Oh what a lurid tale that is! Why, I could go on for hours.",
    "Hmph, well, I suppose. What do you want to know?",
    "I've heard plenty about each of them... but I'll try to keep it as short as I can.",
    "Old Lord Sinclair was a well respected man this side of White Wolf. He was great friends with King Ulthas and did many good works for the kingdom. His children on the other hand were spoiled and horrid. They cared for no one but themselves and gave themselves such aires. Each had their own vice, but I didn't expect any of them would be driven to murder!",
    "They've been living very quietly, a nice change from the norm. But almost too quietly. I always thought they'd get into more trouble. No good will come from them, let me tell you!",
    "The mansion? The mansion is quite new. Originally, the Sinclair family lived in Camelot, although it went under a different name then. But when King Arthur and his knights appeared, old Lord Sinclair agreed with King Ulthas that the knights had greater need for the castle than the Sinclair family. So, Lord Sinclair had the mansion built, packed his family up and vacated. His children were furious with him for doing it. They felt themselves far better than the knights and felt insulted at having to live in a stuffy mansion.",
    "Well, you should know best... Anna killed her father. Poor man.",
    "Anna? The guards are keeping her in the jail in the courthouse in Seers' Village. I heard she's been acting like a royal pain.",
    "Reasoned with? She killed her own father! I hear she's being so unreasonable that no lawyer in RuneScape will represent her. She's going to get a guilty verdict for sure. Still, I go and visit her at the Seers' Village courthouse sometimes to try and keep her spirits up.",
    "At the Seers' Village courthouse.",
    "I hear you're the defence lawyer for Anna, now.",
    "I'm the town gossip, I'm supposed to know this stuff. Are you preparing for the trial?",
    "Well, my father was in the guards and he attended many trails. As a defence lawyer you need to disprove any evidence presented by the prosecution. Disproving it gives reasonable doubt as to whether or not your client actually committed the crime.",
    "Some of it will be the evidence you found: the dagger, the poison and the thread. There was also an eyewitness saying they saw Anna tamper with Lord Sinclair's dinner. Start asking questions about those things and see where you get."

  "Player": [
    "Really? What's happened?",
    "You mean they let the murderer get away?",
    "Anna? Is that who they arrested? I thought...hmm, never mind.",
    "So, why is it a big deal that the Sinclairs have left, then? Maybe they wanted to get away from the memory of their father's death.",
    "How curious. Maybe I should investigate it.",
    "Very odd coincidence, but I don't really have time to look into that now.",
    "So I have heard. The town gossip informed me that something was amiss. I've come to offer my assistance.",
    "How so?",
    "They haven't returned to their other realm have they?",
    "How goes the investigation, then? What evidence have you gathered so far?",
    "Which is why you're happy to see me, right? A rough party could break into the mansion and investigate further, without the fear of losing their job. Am I right?",
    "I have proof that the Sinclairs have left.",
    "Don't you see? The Sinclairs have left for good. They premeditated their departure from the mansion.",
    "I have proof that links the Sinclairs to Camelot.",
    "No... It's not a camel, like the animal. The note isn't whole, they were writing the word Camelot. They were meeting at Camelot, this is our evidence to connect the Sinclairs to King Arthur.",
    "I have proof of foul play.",
    "Exactly. And we know Morgan Le Faye has a history of harassing Merlin and King Arthur. Since there is no sign of a struggle inside the Sinclair Mansion, we can only assume the knights were there by request.",
    "When do you expect to go to Camelot? Perhaps I can assist you?",
    "WHAT? A month or more? King Arthur could be in grave danger. Morgan Le Faye is involved and she is not one to be trifled with. One of the Sinclairs has already committed murder, who's to say another won't? And you're going to wait a MONTH?",
    "Aye, what then?",
    "That's all the advice you can give?",
    "Well, often the best historians are the town gossips, I'd start there. Good luck, brave adventurer!",
    "Hello again. Can you tell me about the Sinclair family history?",
    "Well, I don't really have hours. Can you condense it?",
    "Tell me about the family.",
    "What have they been up to since the arrest of their sibling?",
    "Tell me about the mansion.",
    "What happened next?",
    "Tell me about Anna Sinclair.",
    "But what is she like? Can she be reasoned with?",
    "Tell me where Anna Sinclair is being held?",
    "Hello. Do you remember me?",
    "So he's 'daddy' now is he? If he was so dear to you why did you kill him?",
    "But there's hard evidence against you.",
    "I didn't come here to just chit-chat. I need to know where your family has disappeared to. I have suspicions they've reclaimed Camelot.",
    "Well, I'll be off then. Have fun spending the rest of your life in jail.",
    "Name your price.",
    "Maybe it's because you ARE guilty. your sibling offered hard proof you did it!",
    "Why should I believe you? As far as I know you did kill your father.",
    "So, if I agree to get you a 'not guilty' verdict at trial, you promise me to tell me how to get into this secret passage that will lead me straight into Camelot?",
    "Okay, I guess I don't have much of a choice. I'll go start gathering evidence.",
    "Of what, your guilt?",
    "No, thank you.",
    "How can you possibly know that already?",
    "Well, I'm going to talk to the servants and see if I can learn anything new from them... but other than that, I don't really know what I'm doing.",
    "But how do I know what evidence will be presented?",
    "I'm representing Anna Sinclair as a defence lawyer.",
    "Err, I'm not joking. I have to prove she is innocent.",
    "One of her siblings claims to have seen that, but who can say if they're saying the truth? Beside, it's for King Arthur. Anna is the only lead I have on how to find the King and his knights.",
    "I'm representing Anna Sinclair as her defence lawyer. I need to ask you some questions about what happened the night of Lord Sinclair's murder.",
    "Err, well, circumstances have changed. Anyway, I need to ask you some questions.",
    "What can you tell me about the night of the murder?",
    "Where did you last see Anna Sinclair on that fateful night?",
    "Did you ever see Anna in possession of the dagger that was found embedded in Lord Sinclair's body?",
    "No one else ever touched it?",
    "That's wonderful? Why didn't you mention it before? It means it could have been planted to make it seem like Anna did it.",
    "Can you tell me which Sinclair family member this thread belongs to?",
    "So, you can't identify the owner of the thread for certain?",
    "What can you tell me about the poison?",
    "Do you remember who bought poison?",
    "I'm representing Anna Sinclair as her defence lawyer. I need to ask you some questions about what happened the night of Lord Sinclair's murder.",
    "I'm sorry to trouble you, but I really need some answers.",
    "What can you tell me about the night of the murder?",
    "So, you didn't see Mary deliver the food to Lord Sinclair?",
    "Then someone could have tampered with the meal while she was on the way?",
    "Hmm, right. That doesn't bode well.",
    "Where did you last see Anna Sinclair on that fateful night?",
    "What did she do then?",
    "Well, that's not very conclusive.",
    "Did you ever see Anna in possession of the dagger that was found embedded in Lord Sinclair's body?",
    "Did you see someone else in possession of it?",
    "Can you tell me which Sinclair family member this thread belongs to?",
    "So, you can't identify the owner of the thread, for certain?",
    "What can you tell me about the poison?",
    "Who else bought poison?",
    "I'm representing Anna Sinclair as her defence lawyer. I need to ask you some questions about what happened the night of Lord Sinclair's murder.",
    "I'm sorry to put you through it again, but I really need to get some answers.",
    "What can you tell me about the night of the murder?",
    "There, there. I don't need you to tell me any more of that. What about on the way to the study, did you see Anna?",
    "Really? So, you can't place Anna at the murder scene, but there was a man there? David, Bob or Frank?",
    "That's great news!",
    "Where did you last see Anna Sinclair on that fateful night?",
    "What was she doing?",
    "So she wasn't acting suspicious?",
    "Did you see her anywhere near the scene of the murder?",
    "Very interesting. That's very helpful.",
    "Did you ever see Anna in possession of the dagger that was found embedded in Lord Sinclair's body?",
    "Are you sure?",
    "Can you tell me which Sinclair family member this thread belongs to?",
    "So you can't identify the owner for certain?",
    "What can you tell me about the poison?",
    "Do you know who did?",
    "I'm representing Anna Sinclair as her defence lawyer. I need to ask you some questions about what happened the night of Lord Sinclair's murder.",
    "Well, I have my doubts.",
    "What can you tell me about the night of the murder?",
    "So you didn't see or hear anything unusual?",
    "Where did you last see Anna Sinclair on that fateful night?",
    "Are you certain?",
    "Did you ever see Anna in possession of the dagger that was found embedded in Lord Sinclair's body?",
    "Really? That's not good. Not good at all.",
    "Can you tell me which Sinclair family member this thread belongs to?",
    "So you can't identify the owner for certain?",
    "What can you tell me about the poison?",
    "You're certain you don't remember anything?",
    "I'm representing Anna Sinclair as her defence lawyer. I need to ask you some questions about what happened the night of Lord Sinclair's murder.",
    "Uh, anyways, I need to ask you some questions.",
    "Tell me about the night of murder.",
    "Where did you last see Anna Sinclair on that fateful night?",
    "Did you ever see Anna in possession of the dagger that was found embedded in Lord Sinclair's body?",
    "So, any of the family or servants would have had access to it.",
    "Can you tell me which Sinclair family member this thread belongs to?",
    "So, you can't identify the owner of the thread for certain?",
    "What can you tell me about the poison?",
    "Can you tell me exactly who bought poison from him?",
    "So, you're completely certain all of the Sinclair children bought poison? And it would only have needed a small portion to kill Lord Sinclair.",
    "That means someone could have used the small amount to frame Anna and still have done their chores. That's great news.",
    "I'm representing Anna Sinclair as her defence lawyer. I need to ask you some questions about what happened the night of Lord Sinclair's murder.",
    "I know, I know, but circumstances... well, I just need to ask you some questions, alright?",
    "What can you tell me about the night of the murder?",
    "Where did you last see Anna Sinclair on that fateful night?",
    "Didn't you hear the glass breaking when the window was smashed by the murderer?",
    "Was the dog barking that night?",
    "Did you ever see Anna in possession of the dagger that was found embedded in Lord Sinclair's body?",
    "Did you notice anyone else handle the dagger?",
    "Can you tell me which Sinclair family member this thread belongs to?",
    "So, you can't identify the owner of the thread for certain?",
    "What can you tell me about the poison?",
    "Did you buy any?",
    "Did Anna Sinclair buy any poison?",
    "Oh dear, that's not good.",
    "The defence is ready, Your Honour.",
    "The defence calls the Sinclair's handyman.",
    "What's your name and occupation?",
    "Did you ever see Anna in possession of the dagger that was found embedded in Lord Sinclair's body?",
    "Could you tell us who this thread belongs to?",
    "So, you can't say for certain who this thread belongs to.",
    "Then this thread could have come from either of Anna or David's clothes, and they had many of this colour. A fact that would be known to anyone of the household.",
    "Then the thread could have been planted by someone else to throw suspicion on my client. I think we can all see this thread is very questionable evidence.",
    "What can you tell me about the poison?",
    "You're certain you don't remember anything?",
    "Where did you last see Anna on the night of the murder?",
    "Are you certain?",
    "The defence calls the Sinclair's dog handler.",
    "What's your name and occupation?",
    "Did you ever see Anna in possession of the dagger that was found embedded in Lord Sinclair's body?",
    "So, any of the family or servants would have had access to it.",
    "Could you tell us who this thread belongs to?",
    "So you can't say for certain who this thread belongs to.",
    "Not only can you not identify exactly who this thread came from, but you also state with certainty that Anna and David always wore this colour. Anyone else in the household would have known that as well.",
    "Then the thread could have been planted by someone else to throw suspicion on my client. I think we can all see this thread is very questionable evidence.",
    "What can you tell me about the poison?",
    "Can you tell me exactly who bought poison from him?",
    "So, only a small amount of poison would be enough to kill a man, I suppose?",
    "Therefore, any one of the Sinclairs who bought poison could have done their chore and poisoned Lord Sinclair as well. Just because my client was too lazy to do her chore doesn't mean she poisoned Lord Sinclair.",
    "Where did you last see Anna on that fateful night?",
    "The defence calls the Sinclair's butler.",
    "What's your name and occupation?",
    "Did you ever see Anna in possession of the dagger that was found embedded in Lord Sinclair's body?",
    "No one else ever touched it?",
    "You say you saw someone other than Anna handle the dagger?",
    "Not only has a person other than my client been identified handling the weapon, but the dagger was within easy access to anyone in the household. My client's fingerprints could have been planted on it by another party.",
    "Could you tell us who this thread belongs to?",
    "So, you can't say for certain who this thread belongs to.",
    "Not only can you not identify exactly who this thread came from, but you also state with certainty that Anna and David always wore this colour. Anyone else in the household would have known that as well.",
    "Then the thread could have been planted by someone else to throw suspicion on my client. I think we can all see this thread is very questionable evidence.",
    "What can you tell me about the poison?",
    "Even the servants?",
    "Where did you last see Anna on that fateful night?",
    "The defence calls the Sinclair's cook.",
    "What's your name and occupation?",
    "Did you ever see Anna in possession of the dagger that was found embedded in Lord Sinclair's body?",
    "Did you see anyone else in possession of it?",
    "Could you tell us who this thread belongs to?",
    "So, you can't say for certain who this thread belongs to.",
    "In other words, you are stating that there are two people this thread could have belonged to. Anyone else in the household would have known that as well.",
    "Then the thread could have been planted by someone else to throw suspicion on my client. I think we can all see this thread is very questionable evidence.",
    "What can you tell me about the poison?",
    "Who else bought poison?",
    "Do you know what was done with all the poison?",
    "Could you tell me about the night of the murder?",
    "So, you didn't see Mary deliver the food to Lord Sinclair?",
    "Then someone could have tampered with the meal while she was on the way? Some unknown party?",
    "Err, that will be all. Thank you.",
    "The defence calls the Sinclair's maid.",
    "What's your name and occupation?",
    "Did you ever see Anna in possession of the dagger that was found embedded in Lord Sinclair's body?",
    "You are completely certain of that?",
    "Could you tell us who this thread belongs to?",

    "Then the thread could have been planted by someone else to throw suspicion on my client. I think we can all see this thread is very questionable evidence.",
    "Can you tell the court anything about the poison used to kill Lord Sinclair?",
    "Do you know who did?",
    "Where did you last see Anna on that fateful night?",
    "What about on the way to the study? Did you see Anna?",
    "Really? So, you can't place Anna at the murder scene but there was a man there? David, Bob or Frank?",
    "Indeed. Well, if my client can't be placed at the murder scene, and there is evidence that a man was there, I think it casts a great deal of doubt on the case.",
    "The defence calls the Sinclair's gardener.",
    "What's your name and occupation?",
    "Tell me about the dagger.",
    "Did you ever see Anna in possession of the dagger that was found embedded in Lord Sinclair's body?",
    "Did you see anyone else handle the dagger?",
    "Could you tell us who this thread belongs to?",
    "So, you can't say for certain who this thread belongs to.",
    "Not only are you not sure who this thread belongs to, but you re certain it was their favourite color. Anyone else in the household would have known this as well?",
    "Then the thread could have been planted by someone else to throw suspicion on my client. I think we can all see this thread is very questionable evidence.",
    "What can you tell me about the poison?",
    "Did you buy any?",
    "Did Anna buy any poison?",
    "Right, you needn't go any further.",
    "Where did you last see Anna on the night of the murder?",
    "So, you didn't see any of the Sinclair family outside?",
    "Yes, but what about our deal?",
    "You need to hold up your end of the bargain. Tell me how to get into Camelot or I go back to the judge and tell him I have doubts about your innocence.",
    "What are you going to be doing? Aren't you coming with me?",
    "Riiight.",
    "You! You planned this from the start! Where is King Arthur and his knights? I demand answers!",
    "Why I oughta...",
    "I knew it. I knew Morgan Le Faye had to be involved. Where is King Arthur and his knights? What have you done with them?",
    "I'll foil your plans Morgan, just like I always do. I won't let you win. Good alwa-",
    "Err, no. It was all part of my brilliant plan. I allowed her to capture me so I could find out where she was keeping all of you.",
    "Hey, why do I have to do all the thinking here? You're the brilliant wizard.",
    "Where is King Arthur now? He's not in the jail cell with us.",
    "What is the connection between Morgan Le Faye and the Sinclairs?",
    "So what's the plan of escape? Are you going to teleport us all away? Turn us into fish and swim to sea?",
    "Well, I'm sure if we put our heads together we will think of something. Let's talk about a plan of escape.",
    "How will we go about reclaiming Camelot?",
    "How do you plan to do that? You couldn't even defend it from them.",
    "So to reclaim Camelot, I need to break you out of jail quietly.",
    "How do I retrieve the Holy Grail? Do you know where it is?",
    "The last time I was in Keep Le Faye, it was pretty well guarded. I don't think I'll be able to sneak in quietly.",
    "So, I need to break eight knights out of jail? That could be troublesome.",
    "But it\u2019s locked.",
    "Assuming I can escape from this jail, how can I save King Arthur?",
    "And how do I go about doing that?",
    "WHAT?",
    "Any thoughts on how we could break out of this cell?",
    "Any thoughts on how we could get out of this cell?",
    "Thank you, I will let you know.",
    "Any ideas\u2026",
    "If we break out of this cell, do you reckon you can take on the Black Knights in the keep?",
    "Have you had any brilliant ideas on how to get out of here?",
    "Any thoughts on how we could escape?",
    "Any ideas on how to get out of this cell?",
    "We don\u2019t have a ladder\u2026 but we do have a lot of knights.",
    "Hey guys! I\u2019ve got an idea\u2026",
    "I\u2019m not sure yet. Have you got any useful objects in your pockets?",
    "Pie? How very useful to our cause.",
    "I\u2019m working on it. Have you got any useful objects in your pockets?",
    "I\u2019m not sure yet. Have you got any useful objects in your pockets?",
    "Gee, thanks. You\u2019ve contributed so much to my plan.",
    "I\u2019m not sure yet. Have you got any useful objects in your pockets?",
    "I\u2019m looking for inspiration. Have you got any useful objects in your pockets?",
    "Thanks\u2026 I think.",
    "The quickest way is through the cell door, but I don\u2019t have anything to pick the lock with. Have you got any useful objects in your pockets?",
    "Err, thanks.",
    "I\u2019m not sure yet. Have you got any useful objects in your pockets?",
    "Thanks.",
    "We need to get through the cell door, but I haven\u2019t got anything to open it. Have you got any useful objects in your pockets?",
    "Great, these will be a huge help.",
    "Need a hand?",
    "WHOO! Get \u2018em! Show no mercy.",
    "Give me an R. Give me an O. Give me a U\u2026",
    "You guys deal with the guards. I\u2019ll get the Holy Grail.",
    "Give him a right hook!",
    "How\u2019s it going, Sir Lancelot?",
    "Show them what for!",
    "Now I just need to get out of here and see Wizard Cromperty.",
    "Wizard Cromperty! Merlin sent me. King Arthur has been kidnapped and turned into a granite statue.",
    "He didn\u2019t WANT to be a statue. Morgan Le Faye turned him into one.",
    "Merlin said you might know how to free King Arthur.",
    "Yes, Wizard Cromperty, I remember, I was there.",
    "Why is that?",
    "How do I do that?",
    "That\u2019s not so difficult. I already have the Holy Grail, King Arthur\u2019s most prized possession, and I know he was turned into a granite statue.",
    "So what do I do with this spell?",
    "Merlin suspects King Arthur had been taken to the Black Knights\u2019 Fortress.",
    "Thanks, Wizard Cromperty!",
    "It's no trouble. But we need to get you out of here quickly before any of the Black Knights suspect something.",
    "There's no time to explain; here, take this disguise.",
    "I shouldn't free him without having a disguise to give him, so he can leave safely. Maybe if I dressed him as one of the guards?",
    "I see you made it back safely.",
    "I guess we won't be hearing a peep out of them for awhile.",
    "Good day.",
    "Know you of any quests sir knight?[sic]",
    "I think you should stick to being a knight.",
    "Aww, shucks. It was nothing.",
    "Makes you wonder how they kidnapped you in the first place.",
    "Um... Hello.",
    "Thank you.",
    "You're welcome.",
    "Gee, it was nothing saving you all from the clutches of Morgan Le Faye and freeing your King.",
    "So how did you remove the Sinclairs from Camelot?",
    "How did you get your magic powers back?",
    "You had an exciting day!",
    "Oh, it is, except for that broken window... Very convenient. Where has the Sinclair family gone?",
    "I think you need to look for a new job. Your employers are a bit scary.",
    "I'm looking for clues as to where the Sinclair family has gone. Why can't anyone enter or leave?",
    "How peculiar.",
    "Yes, that was me. Now I'm trying to find out where the Sincalir family has gone.",
    "Right.",
    "Well, I'd not be doing a very good job of it, if I was, considering you're not asleep.",
    "Uh, no. I'm just browsing.",
    "Hi. I was wondering, do you know why the mansion is all locked up?",
    "That's a bit harsh. Thanks anyway.",
    "I'm trying to get into the mansion. Do you know why it's all locked up?",
    "But you're willing to speak to me?",
    "Buck up, man. We'll escape from here and set everything right.",
    "Then why are you in this jail?",
    "Huh, oh no I wouldn't laugh at the greatest knight in the land.",
    "How are things hanging, Palomedes?",
    "How did you let a bunch of Black Knights get the better of you? I thought you guys were the toughest knights around.",
    "Can I speak to her?",
    "May I speak to the prisoner?",
    "What's with the balloons?",
    "Well, being an attorney was an interesting experience.",
    "I know, but I needed to get a 'not guilty' verdict.",
    "What's with the balloons?",
    "Can I speak to my client?",
    "Really? Where is King Arthur now?"

  "Guard": [
    "Good day, [Player]. I'm afraid we meet under strange circumstances again.",
    "Finally, that man serves a purpose. I'm glad to have your help. I'm baffled again and my hands are tied.",
    "The Sinclairs have disappeared, though I'm not sorry to see them go, but what worries me is the disappearance of King Arthur and his knights around the same time.",
    "No, there's no evidence to suggest that. It never sat well with the Sinclair children when their old man gave the castle to king Arthur and moved the family to this mansion. I suspect the murder of old Sinclair was just the the first step in a deeper plot to retake their 'birthright'.",
    "That's the problem. The Seers' Village council has forbidden the guards from breaking into Camelot or the Sinclair Mansion for further investigation. They claim it's a breach of privacy or something like that. My suspicions mean nothing without proof to back them up, but I can't get proof without losing my job.",
    "Exactly! I'm sure you'll manage to find a way into the house.",
    "Any luck getting into the mansion? Did you get some evidence?",
    "A form? What does this prove?",
    "Ah! Of course. Unfortunately, they filled in all of the form except where their new address is.",
    "Really? Where?",

    "Thank you, [Player]. We have all the proof we need to present to the Seers' Village council that something suspicious is going on. They'll review the evidence and hopefully give me permission to take a team to Camelot. It shouldn't be too difficult to get to the bottom of this.",
    "Oh the Seers' Village council convenes in a month or so, I'll present it then. No doubt they'll want a few days to review the evidence. We'll do something after that... if none of the other guards are on holiday. There are only four of us, ya know.",

There's a statue back there, if you pull the arm a secret entrance will appear. Go inside and it will take you straight into Camelot.",

When she heard of the murder of old Sinclair, she learned she was not the only one with a vendetta against Camelot. The Sinclairs have wanted to get their slimy hands on Camelot since their father's death. With Morgan cunning and their riches, they make a formidable team. They bought the services of the Black Knights from Lord Daquarius and overran Camelot. We were outnumbered and taken by surprise. The Sinclairs stole our home, but Morgan struck the greater blow by stealing the Holy Grail, Arthur's most prized possession.",

I used some of my own inventions to create a great deal of chaos and drove them from the house. Then I made sure they returned to their mansion and told them if they ever stepped foot from it again, I'd turn them all into rabbits.",

    "Hanging? I'm not hanging. But I am very angry at being captured by those Black 'Knights', as they call themselves."

  "Sir Lancelot": [
    "No, but when we do, I\u2019m going to make those Black Knights black and blue all over.",
    "How are you going to get all of us out of here?",
    "How dare you attempt to imprison the greatest knight in the land? Have at thee!",
    "Greetings! I am Sir Lancelot, the greatest Knight in the land! What do you want?",
    "Humph. You are indeed a better knight than I first suspected.",
    "I could have taken all of them on! Those black knights wouldn't stand a chance against me, the greatest knight in the land.",
    "They attacked while I was in the bath. What was I to do? Hey, are you laughing at me, the greatest knight in the land?"
  ],
  "Sir Pelleas": [
    "Sir Kay and I noticed a grate high up on the wall that leads to the small docks at the back of the keep, but it\u2019s too high up to reach and we couldn\u2019t figure out a way to boost our height.",
    "How are you going to get all of out of here?",
    "Consider it done.",
    "DIE SCUM!",
    "Greetings to the court of King Arthur!",
    "I am proud to have you as a member of the Round Table.",
    "Greetings, brave knight. I believe you should speak to Merlin, he probably has need of your assistance."

    "Please! Stop the hurting!"

  "Wizard Cromperty": [
    "Why would he want to be a statue?",
    "Oh yes, I see now. Why are you telling me all this?",
    "Oh, well, I don\u2019t know anything about rocks. I\u2019m a teleportation expert, myself. But there was this one time I teleported a girl right into a rock. What a mess that was.",
    "Oh were you? Of course you were. Well, I suppose being turned into a statue is very similar to being teleported into a rock\u2026 Let me see what we\u2019ll need.",
    "If my calculations are correct, this spell will need a bit more \u2018oomph\u2019 than last time around.",
    "Well, before you were simply reanimating the person within the rock. This time you need to unravel Morgan Le Faye\u2019s spell first.",
    "You\u2019ll need King Arthur\u2019s most prized possession. That will unravel Morgan\u2019s spell. Then you\u2019ll need a piece of granite, the same rock Arthur was turned into.",
    "Let me just get that spell scroll for you\u2026",
    "Ah, you still have the Animate Rock spell I gave you from our last adventure in your bank.",
    "Take the scroll, the Holy Grail and a piece of granite, an amount will do, to the statue of King Arthur. Once in front of him, read the scroll and the magic should do the rest.",
    "Where is Arthur being kept, anyway?",
    "Then you\u2019ll need a disguise. You could try asking the fortress guards about their armour, or you could wear black armour if you have any to hand.",
    "Hmmm\u2026I wonder\u2026 if you used a magical object that turned you into stone on the statue, would it turn him back to being human? I must research that\u2026",
    "Oh, are you still here? Go on then, you\u2019ve got a king to save!"

  "King Arthur": [
    "Thank you! I was afraid that would be the end of me.",
    "The Black Knights? I thought Morgan did this to me.",
    "Very well.",
    "You leave first and I'll sneak out in a few minutes. Meet me back at Camelot and I shall reward you generously for your aid.",
    "Indeed, thanks to the disguise you gave me. I arrived back just as Merlin had kicked out the Sinclair children. He scared them off with a few puffs of smoke and frogs. He told them if any of them left their house again, he'd turn them all into rabbits.",
    "Indeed. We of the Round Table are greatly indebted to you for all of your help. I wish to reward you for all the help you have given us...",
    "Welcome, brave knight. I am always happy to see you back at my court. Please feel free to roam the castle and make use of the training grounds."

  "Clerk": [
    "That Sinclair woman is such a pain! She keeps demanding gourmet meals and ridiculous things like silk sheets.",
    "Go ahead. It means she won't be demanding things from me."
  ],
  "Fortress Guard": [
    "I heard something happened to King Arthur and that Lord Daquarius was behind it.",
    "I've no idea, but it's a great victory for Lord Daquarius. To take such a mighty support of the White Knights down... Truly brilliant."
