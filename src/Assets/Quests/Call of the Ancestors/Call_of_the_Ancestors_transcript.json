    "Human! Thank the spirits you've come by. My village is in urgent need of help!",
    "I am Tunks of Village Kanatah on Mazcab. I have come through the world window to find brave adventurers that might be able to help us! I may be young but I'm the first Kanatan to set foot on this lumpy, purple planet. I must say, I didn't imagine the spiky trees and glowing soil.",
    "The devourer spirit?! AAAHH! Save yourself, [good sir/fair maiden]! I will distract the beast with my magnificent rock! Tell the tale of your goebie saviour to the people of-",
    "Ah, yes. I knew that. Sorry, my natural reflexes kicked in. Anyway, that is kind of why we need your help. The airut that Tuska left on our planet attacked Kanatah and are gathering to wipe the village out completely! It seems they've been enraged by the death of one of their chieftains. Your kind have proven yourselves as mighty heroes and I want to be one when I grow up too! Would you help us?",
    "Oh. I understand. You're too busy to help my people's struggle for survival.",
    "Great! Perhaps it would be best for me to return to Mazcab now, my mother will be worried about me. She said I wasn't allowed to come here, so if you see her... Shhh. Anyway, come to Kanatah and speak to the Acca when you're ready. I can't wait to fight alongside a valiant adventurer like you!",
    "When I'm allowed to explore beyond Kanatah I want to climb the tallest mountain on Mazcab!",
    "I'm sorry! The pick wasn't my idea!",
    "Are you feeling lighter though?",
    "Wow.",
    "We've been sent to find Nemi root, your most large... hugeness... one.",
    "Come on Player, I'm eager to look at this temple! Who knows what we might find!",
    "We need to look like the ancient warriors! Close your eyes, Player. I've got an idea.",
    "Ok, we're ready!",
    "I feel strange still. My pebbles are tingling.",
    "Xinachto, you don't look well.",
    "What did you do?!",
    "Thanks, Player. We never would've figured out the trials on our own.",
    "No... We are done with running. Now we fight.",
    "We should talk to the Ancient goebie about the roots we need.",
    "We've got what we came for. Our adventure draws to a close. We should return to Acca Kanatah.",
    "Hey, Player!",
    "I'm on an adventure! I heard about these goebies boldly going where no goebies have gone before and knew I had to join them.",
    "Oh this? It's my new headdress. I met a little man called Gudrik who told me new adventurers all go to Ashdale, so that was the first place I went! The island was in the clutches of Morwenna the Cruel, but she was no match for the power of our ancestors.",
    "Well, I heard there are adventures to be had in a place called Silvarea to the north. That's where I'll head.",
    "Thank you, Player!"

    "Oh, where are you from?",
    "Erm, we're actually on Tuska's back. She crash landed onto our planet...",
    "It's okay, you don't need to be scared. The reason Tuska crash landed was because she was slain.",
    "I met Tunks on the other side of the world window. He said he'd come to our planet to find help for your village and that I should speak to you.",
    "They attack you here all the time though. Isn't dodging those attacks kind of your whole thing?",
    "Ok, I'm ready to help. What do you need me to do?",
    "I think I can see why the Acca asked for my help.",
    "We're supposed to help collect supplies to fix up the area.",
    "Come on.",
    "We've got the wood, what do we need now?",
    "Oh... No, I would never have guessed...",
    "Great, so where do I get more of this poison?",
    "Right, I'll return when I've found something.",
    "I'm no goat! I'm a human.",
    "I'm pretty sure I'm not a goat. I don't have hooves or weird eyes.",
    "Kanatah is at risk of getting overrun by the airut. The root might give them the edge they need to survive.",
    "In a sense you're getting closer, but a Hu-goat isn't an actual thing. Hu-man is the word.",
    "Can you help us?",
    "Holds up?",
    "But how?",
    "What's special about them? Why can't you help your friend yourself?",
    "And you[sic] assistants?",
    "It'll probably be quicker to just help them.",
    "Erm, hello?",
    "What are you then?",
    "You look like a giant tortoise to me.",
    "Why are you here?",
    "Are you a spirit guardian?",

    "Why is your 'vessel' in this temple?",
    "So this is where they come to die?",
    "Do you know anything about the goebie trials?",

    "I'll wait out here for you, good luck!",
    "Was that so much more effort than finding our own roots?",
    "We did it, we freed Xinachto and discovered the temple's magic.",
    "They also wielded powerful magic too, I gather.",
    "If it could save lives, why haven't more goebies completed the trials?",
    "You're saying that the temples of Mazcab are all tributes to you?",
    "You dealt with them swiftly enough.",
    "I met a spirit named Xinachto and a goebie as tall as a tree. They warned me that overuse could come at a price.",
    "Hi Tunks, what are you doing here?",

    "Wow! So what are you planning to do next?",

  "Acca Kanatah": [
    "Is there something you wish to discuss, human?",
    "Hm, I should have known he would disobey his mother. Audacious little goeb, that one. Brave though. Tell me, human, what do you know of the situation here?",
    "Well, yes, but I'm afraid our situation is much more dire than that, my friend.",
    "Mm, indeed. Our situation is certainly a dire one, my friend.",
    "Ha! You are indeed a plucky one. Unfortunately our situation is rather a dire one, my friend.",
    "The airut that harry us have decided enough is enough. Our scouts report that they are amassing forces and preparing to raze Kanatah to the ground. Our homes, our supplies... Possibly even our people, will all be destroyed. Hmm.",
    "Ordinarily, yes. Never before like this though. They're out for blood. It is most troubling. If it wasn't for our diligent rangers we would not have managed to evacuate the village before they came. This time I believe they aim to destroy everything we have built here, yes.",
    "I do not think you quite understand this camp's significance, human. We stand here in open defiance of those monsters! We are here not because of the path that lies before us, but the path that lies behind us. We built this camp right under their noses, and after all this time, after all their efforts to defeat us, I remember that which matters most... WE ARE STILL HERE!",
    "How do you humans say it...'cool beans'? Yes, cool beans. Well my friend, we must prepare ourselves. No longer will we cower and hide from the airut. Today, we will stand strong and repel them! Mm. First things first, seek out Tunks and his friends. I've set them to collecting wood to shore up the village and I suspect they'll need guidance. They should be at the beach to the east. Collect them and I shall come find you.",
    "We're going to need more wood in order to fix the village up. Luckily, my predecessor accumulated a good stock of supplies and hid it from the airut. Unluckily my predecessor was a little too security conscious and hid the logs in a ruin full of obstacles and bottomless pits.",
    "I've asked for you three to join me, as each of you have unique skills that should come in useful. You just need a teacher to help you master them. A teacher like Player.",
    "Nonsense! I'm sure your adventuring experience has left you plenty prepared for this role!",
    "How about we get to it? Lunch, if you clear the entrance?",
    "You'll be fine!",
    "This gap may look intimidating, but you can clear it.",
    "Excellent work, Tunks!",
    "Let's see how the other two do. That wall looks cracked. You should be able to break it Lunch.",
    "That gap looks just small enough that Peck should be able to squeeze through.",
    "Excellent, this should give us the last things we need to fix up the village.",
    "Thank you for rounding these three up for me, Player. Let us speak in the village, I have another task for you.",
    "Is there something you wish to discuss, human?",
    "Yes, excellent, excellent. Hm. I'm afraid that was bit[sic] of a test. The real work is to come. Our appearances may have deceived you, with our solid rocks and muscular physiques, but we are not the most capable of fighters.",
    "Mm, indeed, your kind are so soft and fleshy. It is a wonder you show such strength and resilience! Still, if we are to repel the airut we must learn to defeat them. I believe Nemi poison may be the answer, but it is in short supply. Hmm.",
    "Ah, so you do not know? The poison our scouts have found in Nemi forest seems to be most potent against the airut. Trinks over there has a small supply she has been giving to adventurers in order to weaken the enemy. The effects are quite intriguing, mm. When ingested it reduces the physical capabilities of the victim. Quite useful to level the playing field, you see.",
    "I'm glad you ask, human. Travel to Nemi forest and search for an abundant source of poison. I have heard tales from our scouts of huge plants supplying it! Of course, the Nemi forest can be dangerous and unpredictable. Who knows what you may find within its depths...",
    "Is there something you wish to discuss, human?",
    "Travel to Nemi forest, Player. Search for the poison within!",
    "Is there something you wish to discuss, human?",
    "Welcome back Player. Have you found the poison we need?",
    "Excellent, we shall use this to fight back against the airut! How did the goebs fair? Did you find anything of interest in the forest?",
    "It sounds like your trip went swimmingly. Thank you for helping my village, Player. Please accept these tokens of gratitude.",
    "Incredible! Just think how much we could learn from a towering elder! Mm. It sounds like your trip went swimmingly. Thank you for helping my village, Player. Please accept these tokens of gratitude.",
    "Oh my, that is not at all what I expected. This is far better than poison. We could stop the airut dead in their tracks with this!",
    "Player, I am the Acca of this village. I have gained much wisdom in my time. I will do what is required to keep my people safe, yes? If moderation is the best course of action, you can bet that's the course I'll take. I'll make sure to send a couple of our rangers to find this temple and learn a little more about it. First, please accept these tokens of my gratitude. You have truly changed our lives. Hm.",

    "I'll let you take first crack at it.",
    "I thought I wanted to hurry up and get my grow on, but now I'm not so sure.",
    "[He/She] is a human. I can't speak to the goat bit though, I'm not sure what one is.",
    "You don't look so scary to me.",

    "Yes! That's a great idea! No peeking, Player, we'll know!",
    "I've heard of you! You're Xinachto! I didn't know you could speak.",
