  "Player": [
    "Hello!",
    "Uh\u2026okay, goodbye.",
    "Hello there. My name\u2019s Player.",
    "Why, what do you mean?",
    "Really? What is it?",
    "Why would I want beans exactly? I mean, beans are good, of course, but I\u2019m pretty sure I can get them anywhere.",
    "Ok then. So what do they do exactly?",
    "O\u2026kay. So, are you going to tell me what they do?",
    "So, can I have the beans then?",
    "So, how much gold do you want for the beans, if I decide to buy them?",
    "Oh, I see. Ok then.",
    "Ok, so if I get these items, you will trade them for the beans. Is that right?",
    "What items do you need me to find then \u2013 assuming I still want those beans of course. Not that do, but I might.",
    "What\u2019s so special about it?",
    "Ok, thanks for the advice.",
    "What do you need the feather for?",
    "Thereof?",
    "I guess. If you say so.",
    "How do I find Grimgnash again?",
    "Excuse me\u2026say what now? He chews people\u2019s bones? I thought you said this was an easy task?",
    "You know, I\u2019m not sure that was even a compliment.",
    "What\u2019s the other item I need to find?",
    "Ok. Where can I find him?",
    "Ok, that seems simple enough. I\u2019ll get the helmet for you as well.",
    "Do you have any weird items in your collection?",
    "Ummm\u2026I see. Well, can you tell me about any of them?",
    "A two-eyed cyclops? Uh\u2026wouldn\u2019t that be a normal giant perhaps?",
    "Umm\u2026no, I guess not. Well, what else do you have?",
    "Really? That\u2019s amazing! A Unicorn without a horn?",
    "I expect so. Well, on to other things for now then, I guess.",
    "I should be off, I think.",
    "Uh\u2026hello?",
    "No, wait! I didn\u2019t come to be eaten!",
    "Uh\u2026uh\u2026",
    "I have come for your magic feather!",
    "Do you have any quests for me?",
    "Argh!",
    "I heard you were a great and mighty Griffin!",
    "Perhaps I can help you get to sleep in some way. Is there anything I can do?",
    "So you want me to tell you a bed-time story, is that right?",
    "Right, well I\u2019m sure that shouldn\u2019t be too hard. I know lots of stories!",
    "Death and fire?...ok then. Let me see...",
    "Ok!",
    "There once was a king named Roland.",
    "There once was a princess named Esmerelda.",
    "There once was a little bunny called Flumper.",
    "There once was a graveyard filled with undead.",
    "Uh..yes..yes I suppose they could be.",
    "There lived a skeleton named Grimgnash.",
    "Oh, wait! Sorry! I got that bit wrong there. I was thinking of your name. My mistake! What I meant was..",
    "There lived a skeleton named Boney.",
    "No wait\u2026I\u2026",
    "There lived a skeleton named Harry.",
    "Uh, I\u2019ve not recently\u2026",
    "There lived a skeleton named Skullrot.",
    "I\u2026er..I\u2019m sure nobody would disagree with you.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Skullrot was happy!",
    "Skullrot was sad!",
    "Skullrot was angry!",
    "Uh\u2026he was angry because\u2026er\u2026he had a headache?",
    "Oww!",
    "Skullrot was insane!",
    "That\u2019s\u2026lovely. Uh\u2026shall I continue?",
    "Ok, then. So Skullrot was completely insane. He was off his rocket. One noodle short of a bowl of spaghetti. Not quite all there. Anyway, he was out haunting his graveyard one day when he came across a small gnome.",
    "Uh, I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Anyway, this poor gnome had somehow got his foot stuck under a fallen gravestone.",
    "Skullrot lifted he gravestone off.",
    "Skullrot laughed at the gnome.",
    "In fact, he laughed so hard that he fell backwards into an empty grave and was never seen again. The end.",
    "Eh? Oh, well without Skullrot there he was able to get himself free again and ran away, vowing never to return to the graveyard ever again.",
    "Skullrot left the gnome there to die. So the gnome, thinking this was his chance, found a log to lever the stone off his foot and he scarpered away quickly.",
    "No, wait, I got it wrong! Wait\u2026!",
    "Skullrot hungrily grabbed the gnome\u2019s hair. Skullrot wretched the gnome out with one hand, pulling hard on his hair. The poor gnome\u2019s foor snapped out of the gravestone and went crack as his foot dislocated.",
    "Well, the poor gnome \u2013 Nobby was his name \u2013 was in terrible pain and fear as to what would happen to him next.",
    "Oh, ok. Anyway, the gnome was in awful pain, so Skullrot took him back to his home in his grave where he\u2026",
    "Locked him in an iron cage.",
    "Put him into a pot for dinner.",
    "Locked the gnome in the attic to die.",
    "Started to strangle the poor gnome. The gnome struggled with the cold boney fingers that were trying to end his life until he managed to pry himself free!",
    "Ok, it was all the little gnome could do to crawl painfully across the floor away from Skullrot, who was busy getting a pot to put the gnome in. Then, when all seemed lost for the little gnome, he suddently saw something that might save his little life!",
    "Ok, ok! Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re almost done.",
    "So, then. The gnome looked up and he saw what might be his best chance to get out alive!",
    "He saw a hole he could just fit through.",
    "He saw a small sandwich on the floor.",
    "He saw a big axe leaning on the wall. He crawled painfully, oh so painfully over to the axe. He could use it to kill Skullrot. As he grasped the axe he realised it was a lot heavier than it looked! In fact much heavier indeed! He couldn\u2019t hold it or stop it falling off the wall! SCHNUNK!",
    "As the axe fell, the poor gnome could not get out of the way in time and the razor sharp blade fell CRACK! And it killed him instantly. And so Skullrot was pleased to find that he had a nice dinner for that night and sat down for a big supper! The end. What did you think, Grimgnash?",
    "He saw some bones lying in the corner. He quickly remembered that if he buried them he could get his prayer up and so might be able to cast a heal spell on his legs! He dragged his painful body over to the bones and buried them all \u2013 these was quite a large pile \u2013 in the floor. All of a sudden, he remembered a good spell to heal himself from his injuries. He started to recite the prayer quickly. Just then, a huge zombie appeared out of nowhere and mumbled about his bones being disturbed! The zombie crunched his fist down on the gnome\u2019s head. The gnome cried out in terror and realized that all was lost! He could not get away now! And so, Skullrot decided to invite the zombie to dinner as he never usually had guests. Then the two of them laughed and joked merrily throughout the night with their stomachs full of a hearty dinner! The end. So what did you think, Grimgnash?",
    "No, wait! I was wondering if perhaps I could help you at all. You said you couldn't sleep. Is there anything I can do?",
    "Ok. What can I do?",
    "Hi, Sylas. I have Grimgnash\u2019s feather for you.",
    "Ok, I\u2019ll get that next. I have a question or two I would like to ask you.",
    "Hello there!",
    "Uh, hello there! Can you hear me?",
    "No, no. I\u2019m not either of them.",
    "Ha ha! No, I\u2019m speaking to you through the pipe here! I\u2019m at the bottom of your tower.",
    "Who are you?",
    "Really? Which king?",
    "Hey, you\u2019re not related to Sir Tiffy by any chance are you?",
    "I see. Well is there anything I can do to help you up there?",
    "Sure. What can I do?",
    "Why? I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on!",
    "Right! Let me have a think, then!",
    "I think I might have an idea!",
    "You could try and climb down.",
    "It\u2019s really not that far.",
    "So you won\u2019t try it then?",
    "Right\u2026",
    "I could try speaking to the princess.",
    "Well, I could try and get her to listen to reason, I suppose.",
    "I could kill the princess for you!",
    "Sure, she doesn\u2019t look so tough!",
    "But she kidnapped you. Surely that makes her evil?",
    "Ok\u2026 But it would have been fun though, wouldn\u2019t it? Haha!",
    "She would never have seen it coming! Blam!",
    "Right!",
    "I could try and climb up.",
    "I could try and climb the walls.",
    "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re able to admire the architecture, but you\u2019re still stuck up there!",
    "I can fly!",
    "Well\u2026er, no, sorry. I made that last bit up!",
    "Umm, no I guess not. Sorry about that.",
    "There must be something down here that might help.",
    "I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s really not that high.",
    "Not really, no.",
    "I could ask the princess!",
    "You know, on second thought maybe that\u2019s not such a good idea after all.",
    "Well, I could try and ask her to let you out, perhaps? You know, get her to listen to reason.",
    "Is there anything up there that can help?",
    "Wait! That\u2019s it!",
    "I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to say this, but\u2026Rupert, Rupert, let down your beard!",
    "No, Mean hang you beard down over the tower and I\u2019ll climb up it, ok?",
    "Hello? Rupert?",
    "Climb up how?",
    "Yes, it was quite a climb, but you have a very strong beard.",
    "So, what can I help you with?",
    "A witch? Let me guess, would this witch be her evil stepmother?",
    "I see. Go on.",
    "Really? What happened to him?",
    "Ok, so how can I help?",
    "And then what happened?",
    "Goodness me! How rude!",
    "Ok, let me go and talk to her for you, then.",
    "Oh, no I haven\u2019t had a chance yet. I\u2019ll be back when I have.",
    "Hello there.",
    "Who are you?",
    "Uh, ok. Never mind then!",
    "Excuse me?",
    "Noise? What noise? I didn't hear any noise.",
    "You're not very nice, are you?",
    "I thought princesses were usually kind and loving and graceful?",
    "I see. Well I think I had better go then.",
    "Pardon me\u2026?",
    "Oh, really? Who are you waiting for? Maybe I\u2019ve met them?",
    "Oh, okay. Can I ask you something?",
    "I notice you have a dwarf in the tower here. I was wondering why he is locked in there?",
    "Oh, who\u2019s that then?",
    "But he seems like a very nice person to me. A bit odd perhaps, but couldn\u2019t you let him go?",
    "Oh go on. Please?",
    "Really?",
    "Pardon me, your ladyship.",
    "Pleased to meet you Princess Miarz\u2026er\u2026Mizaz\u2026Miquipzi\u2026Marzipan?",
    "Oh. Ok, I see. That\u2019s an unusual name. Where is it from?",
    "I happen to notice that there is a slightly embarrassing looking dwarf in the tower there.",
    "Your first-cousin, once removed?",
    "You second-cousin, once removed?",
    "Your first-cousin, twice removed?",
    "Your second-cousin, twice removed?",
    "What\u2019s so special about it? I\u2019ve seen pianos all over the place.",
    "I see. Thank you for that\u2026er\u2026useful knowledge.",
    "Yes, that\u2019s actually why I came to speak with you. I was wondering if you couldn\u2019t let Rupert go? He\u2019s a nice fellow and I can\u2019t think he\u2019d have done anything wrong.",
    "Surely there must be something that will change your mind? Is there anything you want?",
    "Ok, what\u2019s that?",
    "Ok, go on.",
    "So you would like me to find it for you?",
    "Very well, I will find it for you.",
    "Where is your second-cousin\u2019s house?",
    "Hey! I know that house! I rescued some little kid\u2019s ball from there!",
    "Oh dear.",
    "What does your pendant look like?",
    "Is it particularly valuable?",
    "Where are you the princess of exactly?",
    "How far, exactly?",
    "Oh. What\u2019s the place called?",
    "Asgarnia? Aren\u2019t we in Asgarnia?",
    "Uh\u2026I see.",
    "How impressive!",
    "I need a key for the house.",
    "Thanks very much.",
    "I should be off, I think.",
    "Please can you repeat that last bit? A flock of noisy birds flew overhead there and I couldn't hear you.",
    "Hi Rupert.",
    "Sort of. She\u2019s asked me to do something for her first.",
    "I have to find a gold pendant of hers that she lost in that witch\u2019s house south of Taverley.",
    "Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be careful. I\u2019ve been in there once before, so I know what\u2019s there.",
    "No, I don\u2019t think so. I would have remembered. I was looking for a ball for a boy who had lost it in the witch\u2019s garden.",
    "Yes, quite. I\u2019ll see what I can find out though.",
    "Why are you in that cage?",
    "That\u2019s awful! Why did she do that?",
    "Your ogleroots? I don\u2019t think I understand. What secret is that?",
    "That\u2019s amazing! But how do you move the ogleroot around if it\u2019s so big?",
    "That\u2019s amazing! So how does the witch fit to all this?",
    "So she hasn\u2019t found out the spell yet?",
    "I see. Can I get you out of these somehow?",
    "So, will you be alright?",
    "I found your pendant, Princess Miazrqa!",
    "Umm, your second-cousin has some very strange\u2026creature she keeps.",
    "Uh\u2026Really?",
    "With his ear?",
    "I think I feel a little ill\u2026",
    "Will you agree to let Rupert go free?",
    "Ok, here you are.",
    "I\u2019m just happy I could help\u2026hey! What happened to your long beard? Where did it go?",
    "Oh yes! I can see it now. That\u2019s pretty clever!",
    "Please could I have the helmet?",
    "So what will you be doing now, Rupert?",
    "I\u2019m glad I could help.",
    "Princess Miazrqa, I found out what your cousin is up to.",
    "So you didn\u2019t know that she kidnaps poor defenceless gnomes?",
    "I thought so too.",
    "Yes. There is a gnome in her basement right now!",
    "You know, Rupert \u2013 the dwarf here \u2013 is trying to put a stop to what\u2019s going on, I am sure he could use your help.",
    "Great! Thanks.",
    "Rupert, I told Miazrqa about what the witch was doing and she was horrified by it.",
    "Yes. Miazrqa has said she would like to help you with your investigations and that you can use this tower as your base of operations if you want.",
    "Well, I had better be going for now. Good luck.",
    "I managed to get Rupert\u2019s helmet for you.",
    "Difficult? You have no idea! There were huge creatures trying to eat me, other creatures trying to tear me apart, witches, gnomes in distress, princesses, and I had to deal with them all!",
    "What?",
    "Yes, that\u2019s what all this was about wasn\u2019t it? Some beans! They must be worth a lot for this much trouble!",
    "Worthless? So why did I go to all this trouble for you? I\u2019m not particularly happy about that.",
    "Ok, so then what do I do?",
    "Our prize? What exactly is this prize?",
    "A golden goblin?",
    "They mutinied?",
    "That\u2019s horrible! Was he killed?",
    "But surely that\u2019s what anyone would have done? Why is that a bad thing?",
    "Oh, I see. So Gubblebak became hard as a rock?",
    "So let me see if I have this straight. I need to plant the beans in the earth mound, water them, let them grow into some big plant and then climb the plant to get to a cloudy area, find a golden goblin and bring it back to you?",
    "The\u2026giant?",
    "No. I\u2019m pretty sure you didn\u2019t mention any giants! What giant? Now would be a good time to mention it if you were going to!",
    "So how exactly do I get the goblin then?",
    "Ok then, to recap. I need to plant the beans over there, water them, let them grow into some big plant, climb the plant to get to a cloudy area, kill a giant, find a golden goblin and bring it back to you?",
    "Thanks\u2026I think I\u2019m going to need it.",
    "I\u2019ve grown the beans into a huge stalk, as you asked. What am I supposed to do now?",
    "No.",
    "Where can I find it?",
    "Right, I\u2019m on my way.",
    "Sylas! I found the golden goblin!",
    "Ok, so what should we do?",
    "Right!",
    "Can you remind me what I am doing now?",
    "No, I just can\u2019t remember what I\u2019m supposed to do.",
    "Right!",
    "Yes, it\u2019s done.",
    "I\u2019m glad I could help.",
    "It did indeed seem like an odd item to look for.",
    "Not more potions? I\u2019ve had enough of potions for now.",
    "Oh! Well, that would explain Rupert\u2019s beard then.",
    "Hello Sylas.",
    "How is the collection going now?",
    "I\u2019m just happy that I could help. Goodbye!"
  ],
  "Sylas": [
    "Can\u2019t talk! Things to collect, magic beans to plant!",
    "Ahhh, good day young adventurer. A good day indeed! Sylas is the name. It is lucky for you that you met me.",
    "Well it just so happens, Player that I have something you simply must have!",
    "Beans, my friend! Beans!",
    "Ahhh, but not beans like this, young Player. No, not at all! There \u2018magic\u2019 beans.",
    "Ah excellent question! Excellent question indeed! What do they do? What do they do? Yes, yes! A most excellent question!",
    "You must plant them in the ground. Water them well. Then the magic will work, it\u2019s\u2026er\u2026magic\u2026yes! Plant them, Player.",
    "All in good time, my excitable young friend. All in good time. Few things in this world are free, you know, and beans \u2013 magical or otherwise \u2013 are no exception!",
    "Ah, well you see now I am a collector of rare and unusual trinkets and objects. Not much in value, but very important to me.",
    "Right, well I think that for the magic beans, I will need something magical back and I know just the right items that would help my collection.",
    "Yes! Excellent! You do catch on quick! I can see that we will become great business partners indeed. Oh, yes. Yes indeed! Hmm-ha! Yes.",
    "Well, there are two. The first item should be nice and simple for you to get for me. I want a griffin feather. Now, this is not just any feather, this one is special.",
    "There is a griffin names Grimgnash who lives in a nest on one of the peaks of White Wolf Mountain. It is one of his feathers that I want. But although this task should be easy, you must be careful Player. Grimgnash has very bad temper and even sharper claws!",
    "I told you, player. It is for my collection of magical items and trinkets, weird and wonderful thereof.",
    "Yes, I was quite happy with that word. I think it went rather well in that last sentence, don\u2019t you?",
    "Yes, Excellent! Now\u2026er\u2026was there anything else?",
    "When he\u2019s not chewing on some poor soul\u2019s bones or raining terror on an unsuspecting village, he can be found in his nest, atop White Wolf Mountain.",
    "Oh, I daresay he has to eat sometimes. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019d take too much fancy for you. Not much meat on you at all. Oh dear me, no!",
    "I\u2019m sure it was meant to be! Don\u2019t worry, Player, you\u2019ll be fine. Now was there anything else?",
    "Right, well, the second item is this. I know of a dwarf named Rupert the Beard who has a very fine dwarven helmet. I\u2019d like you to see if you can obtain it for me.",
    "Travel north-east from here and between the Goblin Village and Ice Mountain you will find Rupert in a tower there.",
    "Excellent! Yes, yes. Now was there anything else?",
    "Haha! Weird items? Oh yes. Yes indeed! Yes. Many items. Many items. Yes.",
    "Hmm. Well let\u2019s see now. I have the second eye of a mutant two-eyed cyclops. That was a rare find indeed! And at a tidy price too!",
    "Whatever do you mean? How many mutant two-eyed cyclops do you think are out there? Not many, I\u2019d wager!",
    "Ah, well I\u2019m glad you asked. My most prized possession to date: Through my connections, I managed to acquire a horn-less Unicorn!",
    "Yes. Yes indeed! Indeed yes! And I\u2019m very proud of it, too! It was an exceptionally lucky find, I must say!",
    "Of course. Was there anything else you wanted?",
    "Excellent, excellent! Best of luck then, my friend. I\u2019ll be right here waiting for you to return.",
    "Ah! Good work. Let me take that from you then. I still need you to find Rupert the Beard\u2019s Helmet for me.",
    "Of course. Go ahead.",
    "Excellent, Player! I\u2019ll take that as well. I hope all this work wasn\u2019t too difficult.",
    "Goodness me! I\u2019m glad I sent you instead of going myself.",
    "Er\u2026I mean I knew sending you was the right thing to do. I was sure you could handle anything that came up. Now then, the beans\u2026",
    "Actually, the beans are almost worthless.",
    "Calm down, my young hot-headed friend. There was a good reason for getting these beans. Now that you have proven yourself worthy of being a competent and trustworthy treasure collector, I can tell you the real use for the beans. As I said before, these beans are magical. There is a specially prepared mound of earth right next to us here. Plant the beans there and then be sure to water well. You will need to have some knowledge of farming for this.",
    "Well the beans are planted and watered, they will grow into an enormous plant of some sort. I\u2019m not sure what exactly. At the top of this plant is our prize.",
    "The ultimate collectible item, my dear friend. It is rumoured that in a land of clouds, where none dare to tread lest they plummet to the earth, lies a goblin made of gold\u2026",
    "Yes. Yes, indeed! A golden goblin. Legend tells of a time when goblins discovered gold in an abandoned dwarf mine and began to mine and smelt it. What for, nobody knows. Something evil, I\u2019d wager. The goblins produced great smelting works, overseen by a particularly smart goblin with a head for business. Gubblebak was his name. He was shrewd, cunning and he loved gold\u2026 He worked his fellow goblins day and night to produce more and more gold, until finally they could stand his hard labour no more and they mutinied.",
    "That\u2019s right. They turned on him. No-one is sure about the exact events, but somehow Gubblebak fell into one of the smelting pots of liquid gold.",
    "Well now, goblins are tough little creatures and he managed to somehow crawl out of the pot covered in hot, molten gold. He was smart indeed, but even smart people do foolish things. He threw himself into a nearby water trough.",
    "Ahh, well you see\u2026when you take hot liquid metal and cool it instantly, it becomes rock hard straight away. That\u2019s how blacksmiths make their weapons and armour.",
    "That\u2019s right. And that\u2019s the way he stayed ever afterwards. So the legend says, at least. And the cloud area will be waiting for you when you have planted the beans to find this golden goblin.",
    "Exactly right! You\u2019ve got it! Now did I mention about the giant?",
    "Yes, that\u2019s right. The giant.",
    "Oh right, sorry. Mist have slipped my mind. There's a bit of a large-ish giant up there. Uh\u2026shouldn\u2019t be anything to worry about. But\u2026uh\u2026I think he might have the goblin, you see.",
    "Well, you\u2019re probably going to have to kill him for it. But\u2026but a big strong adventurer like yourself shouldn\u2019t have any trouble whatsoever with that, I\u2019m sure! Here are the beans as promised.",
    "Oh, well done! You do pay attention! Good luck!",
    "Hmm, have you climbed up the stalk yet?",
    "Right, then you will need to climb the stalk and find the golden goblin for me.",
    "I think a big giant has it at the top of the stalk. You will need to get it from him.",
    "Excellent work, Player! Now, that giant will likely have friends. It is too dangerous to leave that stalk up there like that.",
    "First, let me take that goblin from you. Next we need to cut down that beanstalk as soon as possible. I hope you\u2019re a good woodcutter. Find a hatchet. Any hatchet should do. Then cut down that stalk as soon as you can before another giant finds out what you have done and comes for us!",
    "You\u2019ve forgotten already? Did you get hit on the head by that giant? Do you have amnesia?",
    "I see. Find a hatchet. Any hatchet should do. Then cut down that stalk as soon as you can before another giant finds out what you have done and comes for us!",
    "Have you cut down the stalk?",
    "Good work, Player! At last we can relax. We\u2019ve completed our task and you have done me a great service!",
    "Now, let me award you. You may have wondered what possible use I could have had for Rupert\u2019s helmet.",
    "Ah, yes! However, tucked inside the helmet is a tiny bottle with a very special potion. It was made by a witch, south of Taverley, but Rupert must have found it. Not knowing what the potion was, he simply tucked it away in his helmet.",
    "Relax, my friend. This potion is almost harmless. It is actually a particularly strong hair-tonic.",
    "Yes, indeed! I also imagine poor Rupert never understood why his beard grew so alarmingly fast. Poor lad. Anyway, I have removed the potion now and you may keep the helmet along with your rewards. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s quite harmless and the helmet should help you in your adventures.",
    "Ah, Player! Good to see you again.",
    "Thank you for finding the golden goblin for me. I am the envy of the collector\u2019s group. I can\u2019t thank you enough.",
    "Goodbye."

    "I suppose so.",
    "You are a nosy young person! Well, if you must know, he\u2019s in there because I have caught him for someone.",

    "Hmm, well as you asked nicely. Ok then.",
    "No! Now please leave. You're annoying me!",

    "Miazrqa. With a silent Q.",
    "My birth certificate. Now how can I be of help?",
    "Yes, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m waiting for him to be collected by someone.",
    "Why yes! That was a very clever guess indeed! She\u2019s actually a very powerful witch. Now allow me to reward you in some way as I am feeling generous. My second-cousin is always telling me that knowledge is power, so here is a bit of knowledge for you\u2026",
    "As I said, my cousin is a witch but she is also a lover of music. She has a lovely gramophone and keeps a piano in her basement \u2013 why? I have no idea \u2013 but you may find it interesting to examine.",
    "I don\u2019t really know. I know my cousin goes on about that piano a lot, but I\u2019ve played on it many times and I can\u2019t figure out why she likes it so much.",
    "Now as I was saying, my second-cousin, twice-removed is coming to collect the dwarf. She will find out why he\u2019s been snooping around. She has most\u2026persuasive methods.",
    "Ha! That won\u2019t matter to my cousin. She values her privacy above all else, you see.",
    "Hmmm\u2026well I suppose there is something you can do for me that will change my mind.",
    "I was at my second-cousin\u2019s house just the other day when I suddenly dropped a very valuable pendant that I was wearing. The chain must have broken, you see.",
    "Well, no sooner had it touched the ground when all of a sudden a mouse ran out from a hole in the wall. It took my pendant in its teeth and disappeared back inside its hole. As I\u2019m sure you will believe, I was most upset as the pendant was a gift from my mother. I simply must get it back somehow.",
    "Oh, yes please! It means so much to me. If you are able to find the pendant for me, I will let your dwarf friend go.",
    "It\u2019s not far to the west of here, south of Taverely village. It has a beautiful long garden \u2013 you can\u2019t miss it!",
    "That was you? Oh, my cousin was absolutely furious when she found out about that! She went on about it for ages and even made her hair turn a quite ghastly green colour!",
    "Well I suggest you be extra careful when you look for my pendant then.",
    "It\u2019s a lovely gold pendant.",
    "Only to me really, it\u2019s not worth much and isn\u2019t magical, but it has a lot of sentimental value. IT was my mother\u2019s pendant. She gave it to me on my tenth birthday.",
    "I am the daughter of a great and powerful king. In a land far, far away.",
    "Far, far.",
    "Asgarnia.",
    "Well\u2026yes, I suppose, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not far, far away from somewhere else.",

    "I see. How ghastly. Let me continue.",
    "Oh, how wonderful! I\u2019m so grateful.",
    "Oh yes. Those are her little darlings. I shudder to think what she might do if something were to happen to any of them.",
    "Oh yes. Why, only last month one of them got out for a wander and some horrid farmer attacked it with his ear!",
    "Indeed! Tried to choke the poor thing with it. Anyway, my cousin went into a frightful rage and turned that wretched farmer into one of his own chickens. We had a lovely roast meal that day. Happy memories\u2026",
    "Oh dear, I hope you\u2019re not coming down with something. Now, can I have the pendant please?",
    "Of course. The pendant means more to me than anything.",
    "Thank you brave adventurer. I will release the dwarf now.",
    "Really? You know, I have always wondered. She\u2019s ever so secretive and never tells me anything. I was hoping she might tell me when I saw her next.",
    "What?! Never! That\u2019s absolutely awful! How could she? Oh, that\u2019s just so\u2026so\u2026mean!",
    "It\u2019s quite hard to believe. Do you have any proof?",

    "Right, well a young gnome friend of mine by the name of Winkin recently disappeared whilst delivering ogleroots to the market in Draynor.",

    "My investigations brought me to our friend the princess down there, old pi\u00f1ata. She\u2019s related to this witch, as I mentioned. I was\u2026you know\u2026showing a bit of interest in her to get her to give me information.",
    "She invited me back to her \u2018tower\u2019, saying she would tell me all I wanted to know, and then as I walked in the door she slammed it shut behind me.",
    "Yes, indeed! Rude indeed! Then, as I was hammering on the door I heard a hissing sound and smelt something strange. The next thing I remember is waking up to find my armour gone! That wench must have taken it!",

    "Oh, right. What was that then, old parrot?",
    "By all the gods! You have to go in there? You must be careful, Player. She\u2019s a willy one that witch, from what I\u2019ve heard. No doubt there\u2019s all sorts of weird magics over there!",

    "Hah! Don\u2019t fret, old penny whistle! It\u2019s still here. The front of my armour was specially crafted to allow my beard to fold up inside. Do you see?",
    "Indeed it is, old cheese! Now allow me to reward you in some way. All I have is my armour, but you are welcome to take any piece of it that you wish.",

I used a spell learned from a chap named Larry to shrink \u2018em down really small so that I could carry whole bags filled with \u2018em to the market place. Then when I got there, I would use the growing spell once more to make \u2018em huge and sell \u2018em for a tidy sum.",
