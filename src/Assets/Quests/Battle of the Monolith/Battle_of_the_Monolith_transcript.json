    "Good to see you, despite the circumstances.",
    "I am keeping well. My brethren, however, have not been so fortunate. Even without the Crown, Saradomin proves a worthy match for both Azzanadra and Nex. The rest of their forces seem to have underestimated the fervour of yours. Who would have thought it?",
    "...",
    "I may have spoken too soon.",
    "So he's really gone.",
    "Who can say? He has survived at least one apparent death. Is Erebus worse than that? I don't know. As for when he may return...I don't know. Perhaps tomorrow, perhaps beyond both our lifetimes. Azzanadra would know more than I. See what has has to say, once this is all over.",
    "Could you persuade them to join us, Player?",
    "Go, then. You can find them on Karamja, in TzHaar city. I believe the Fight Kiln is a good place to look. And please hurry.",

One here, and one beyond Freneskae. Shadow breaches. The Codex was made to seal this one, to protect Gielinor from the entropic energies that emerge. On the other side of the breach is another reality. A very different reality.",

I can sense them. We're taking losses, and it's stranger than it looks. Some are falling, half-drained of life, without a scratch on them. Just being near the portal seems to be harmful. Those of us with stronger dispositions are holding up for now, but I don't know how long that will last.",
    "Yes. And I would welcome suggestions.",
    "They can be strong, but so few remain on Gielinor. I believe Armadyl is away, on Tarddiad. We don't have time to mount an appeal.",

    "All quiet, for now. The portal remains closed and nobody has tried to meddle with it from this side either. Apart from those archaeologists, of course. They seem determined to cause trouble. Must be something about spending all their time in the dirt.",
    "Indeed. Saradomin's expedition to restore Fern's undead herd to life. We eagerly awaited you, for quite some time. I sent word to you, but received no reply. It seems you were occupied; adventuring with mahjarrat and dragonkin and gods greater than gods. With surprising regularity, you take it upon yourself to save the world from impending calamity. We postponed our quest for a suitably polite period, but the corruption contaminating my body (and Fern's nagging) drove me to action. In your absence, Saradomin joined us on our quest, and battled undead horrors by my side.",
    "On the contrary. Shortly after your departure, Saradomin entrusted the wand to me. Saradomin also apologised for his act of wrath. Understand, my friend. It is nothing short of a miracle that I stand before you. Your unwillingness to trust Saradomin with the wand, though well-intentioned, was nearly my undoing. I understand if you doubt my words; if you see me as a zealous acolyte, blinded by faith and bereft of reason. But Saradomin told the truth. Only a god could have brought a creature like me, twice-dead, back to life as Saradomin did. Saradomin willingly sacrificed divine power to do so. Immune to godhood as you are, he could not transfer his power to you. This was the only way to save me. I wish you had not hesitated to give the wand to Saradomin. While you argued with him, my soul faded, and corruption filled the void in me. I understand that you have your reasons for doing so. Good reasons. I respect that. And I am grateful to you both for returning me to life. But I want you to understand that Saradomin shows remorse for his actions. Though he is not solely to blame for the half-man I have become.",
    "Saradomin entrusted the Wand of Resurrection to me. He is wise enough to recognise its power was safest in a mortal's hands.",
    "Ahem, yes, I must admit, I made assumptions by referring to it as a 'burial ground'. While we waited for you to join us, Fern was kind enough to educate me, in laborious detail, of her people's culture. The centaurs do not bury their dead. It would be a terrible waste of good hors-- hornless unicorn meat. Every fallen comrade is precious to the centaurs, and they fashion the hide, hair and bone into tools and clothing. Unrelentingly enthused by my feigned interest, Fern told me much more of the origin of centaurs. They're tales for another day, perhaps.",
    "Not...exactly. To save us a hazardous journey, Saradomin teleported himself and I to Fern's ancient camp in the deep wilderness, on the shores of the northern sea. With her spirit fettered to the Wand of Resurrection in my hand, Fern had no choice but to join us. Fern's herd were nomadic, their encampments temporary and portable. So there was nary a trace of the centaur camp this long after the god wars. Fern pointed out the site where her elder sister died; where Elora gave the last of her life to heal their herd's dead and dying. This was where Fern cut the horn from Elora's forehead, and tried to bring her people back to life. Instead, Fern raised undead...corrupt, wicked and violent...who murdered everyone in the encampment. As if conjured by Fern's mournful memory of her death, the corrupted centaurs arose from the ocean. They galloped from the salt water in frothing waves. Saradomin gazed upon the corrupted with weary recognition. These...these necrotaurs had been in torpor for centuries, marinating in the same corruption that pulses in my veins. Grotesque malevolent abominations. The skin of the terrible riders was sickly translucent. The corruption had warped their forearms into elongated blades of razored bone. I could see the eerily glowing veins of corruption through their corded muscles and rippling sinews, pumping with unnatural vigour. A thin layer of mucus covered their skinless bodies, stinking a putrid odour. Black toxic vapours reeked from their mouths, withering the scant vegetation in a terrible blight. Worse yet, despite their surprisingly fleshy nature, the necrotaurs seemed invulnerable. Every wound Saradomin inflicted immediately closed. I decapitated a necrotaur and it immediately grew another head. Clearly no mortal weapon could slay these beasts, so I wielded the Wand of Resurrection. I commanded the necrotaurs to obey me. I pointed the wand at a necrotaur and willed it to be restored to life. Nothing.",
    "I passed the trial of blood, so proved myself worthy. But that was before the corruption took hold of me. I can only assume this rendered me compromised.",
    "It was you that passed the trial of blood, not I, so the wand would not respond to me. We needed another plan.",
    "Saradomin conjured a glimmering barrier to hold back the necrotaur horde. He calmly advised Fern to peer into the spirit realm, and describe to us their spectral forms. Fern surprisingly reported that these foul creatures were not soulless, as she first believed. Each necrotaur was a prison, their body a cage for a host of souls. Whenever a necrotaur slew a living person, the necrotaur captured their soul, binding it to their necrotic flesh, to empower and sustain them. I understood, then, what needed to be done. Fern's herd could not pass on to the next world, just as she was bound to the wand by her regret and guilt. Saradomin said she needed to let them go. She needed to let the memory of her herd die, in order for all of them to be free and move on. So, while Saradomin and I fought the necrotaurs in the corporeal realm, Fern fired spectral arrows from her ghostly bow at the centaur spirits, trapped in their cages of necrotic flesh. The necrotaurs weakened as Fern released the spirits of her herd from their terrible limbo. Their flesh ceased to regenerate. The luminous blood dried in their veins. The necrotaurs diminished to shambling animated husks, which we steadily dispatched. Fern circled the necrotaurs, kicking at any that sought to flank us, and continued to shred the spirits of her herd with spectral arrows. By severing their spirits from the flesh that bound them to the corporeal realm, Fern atoned to each of her family in turn. With ghostly tears streaming down her cheeks, she earned forgiveness for murdering her people, and trapping them in tormented unlife. I swung my blade at the necrotaur husks until exhaustion overwhelmed me. Eventually I collapsed, no strength remaining to lift my sword. Saradomin stood over me and shielded me from hoof, blight and claw. Any that dared approach us, he dissolved in divine radiance. My strength renewed and spirits lifted, I staggered to my feet and stood beside the lord of light, battling the undead. It was glorious. Finally we dispatched the last of the necrotaurs, and the battlefield was silent. The dismembered corpses were still and quiet as the grave. I lifted my aching head, and caught a last glimpse of Fern's flickering form. The luminance of her spirit had waned with each light she extinguished. Together, we had resolved her unfinished business, unravelling the ties that bound her to this world. I could barely make out the silhouette of her, knelt on all four knees beside the heap of stinking corpses. Fern gazed at Saradomin, calm and peaceful, her features no longer strained by grief and remorse; strong in the knowledge that she would be reunited with her family. Though her connection to the corporeal realm was now too weak to hear her, I saw her lips form the words 'thank you', and Fern faded from the world of the living.",
    "During our journey back to Asgarnia, Elora's horn crumbled to dust in my hand. I felt a jolt of energy course up my normally numb arm, but that is all. The corruption remains. I surmise that it was Fern's grief that bound her spirit to the wand, and sustained its power over death. Or perhaps there was something more. I do not know. I'm just glad to be rid of the blasted thing. Even the power of a god has its limits, and we endured an exhausting battle. Saradomin could have drawn upon the resources of his followers, but he seemed to savour the solitude of a trek across the wilderness, and a reprieve from mortal politics, while his power regenerated. Saradomin seemed troubled and grave, so as we travelled, I too contemplated my thoughts. At first, I was relieved. Fern and her herd were at peace. Our quest was complete! But doubt clawed at my mind as we drew closer to Falador castle. I had failed to restore the centaurs to life. The Wand of Resurrection was no more. And the corruption continued to cast its shadow over me. Eventually, I could stand the aching silence no longer, and blurted out my fears. Had we failed in our quest? Was my god angry? Disappointed? But, I need not have worried. In Saradomin's eyes, we had accomplished all that he desired and more. It is peace that he sought for the centaurs, not war. Together we're actively seeking a cure for my corruption, but with the destruction of the wand, the creep of my contamination seems to have halted, for now. The troubling voices have sufficiently quietened that I can usually pay them little mind. Sometimes I sense a spark of power in my corrupted flesh. It may prove useful, in time."
