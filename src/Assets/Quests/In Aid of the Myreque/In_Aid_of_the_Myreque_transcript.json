    "That murderer Vanstrom has killed Sani and Harold! He came in and killed them right in front of our eyes. And that beast he summoned probably would have killed the rest of us if it wasn't for you!",
    "That is for your conscience to bear, but now perhaps you can understand why we fight for our freedom?",
    "Hmm, well, thanks for your support. But I'll need to talk to my superior first.",
    "Hmm, well, perhaps there is my friend, but I also have some information which I should like to impart to you first.",
    "You may know a brief history of Morytania already, if not then this will possibly mean little to you. I will let you into my confidence in this matter. With this knowledge you may serve us well in the future. I pray that you share with us as I will share with you now.",
    "In the early history of Morytania seven warrior priests helped to drive the darkness back from Misthalin into what we now call Morytania. And the priests of Saradomin would have you believe that all seven are buried within the holy temple on the Salve. Information I have leads me to believe that one warrior priest, so bent on the destruction of evil, made countless charges deep into Morytania. His name was Ivandis and we believe that he perished within the lands now spoilt by Lowerniel Drakan.",
    "I have long believed that the warrior priests that fought so bravely had aid from the gods. Perhaps not directly, but in some hidden form. Perhaps an item of some usefulness which may have been used against the foe. It's clear to me that these priestly warriors were powerful but perhaps may have mainly fought weaker minions of darkness. Foes which a trained and brave adventurer could dispatch.",
    "Perhaps they did, eventually. But I like to consider that they may have found some ways to combat this evil. There is much history in this land, much that we may make use of to fight our cause. My wish is that you keep your eyes open for information which may give us a clue to Ivandis' resting place. It is said he had an item of no small power. This would be a great artefact to reclaim, if, in fact it still exists.",
    "Certainly, but the information I have to impart is of importance, please I beg you, ask me about it when you're ready. I can understand your impatience for action, I feel it myself, but forewarned is forearmed as Sani used to say.",
    "Very well. Seeing as our base of operations has been discovered by Vanstrom and we need to evacuate before the entire Vyrewatch descends on us, we'll need to relocate. We've been hiding in the caves to avoid detection for sometime, but now we need to move on.",
    "To the south of Mort'ton we've become aware of a nearly deserted township known as Burgh De Rott. It's a ghastly place where the few escapees from the Sanguinesti region have collected. Please go down to this town and try to establish a new base of operations for us.",
    "Please do not underestimate the importance of this request. In addition to founding the base, we need to ensure that the township can help to support our cause. Help the locals with as many requests as you can in order that they may be well disposed to our efforts.",
    "That is great news my friend, and very good luck to you.",
    "Indeed, well met Player.",
    "Please go to Burgh De Rott and endeavour to resource a new base camp for us. Please afford the locals any help and assistance you can muster so that they may be persuaded to help us in our fight.",
    "Fear not my friend, I will come to your aid.",
    "Never fear, Veliaf is here!",
    "Come let us slay these dogs!",
    "Fight on...bravely...let's go!",
    "En garde!",
    "Have at thee!",
    "Take that you fiend!",
    "I have to leave friend...I grow unwell from this combat.",
    "After you've informed Radigad and Polmafi that our new base is in Burgh de Rott, please take Ivan to the temple for his own safety. I've already discussed this with him. Just explain when you're ready and he'll go with you.",
    "The Inn is going to be our new base. We've struck a blow against Vanstrom. A small one admittedly, but we should now disappear for while. The inn basement you dug out seems functional enough to me. When we get down there, we'll clean it up a bit more and get it functional and I want Polmafi and Radigad down there for backup.",
    "It could be a load of rubbish, but it may be worth looking into. I recognise at least two of those items as ingredients for a potion. Though why he would mention garlic and silver is not really apparent at the moment. Perhaps the vampyres have a strong reaction against those two items as well?",
    "A good question my friend, but I have no answer for you. Perhaps you can experiment?",
    "He'll be safer there under the eye of Drezel, I don't have the time to watch over him while we're in this sort of area. You may have noticed that Ivan has special talents. Vanstrom would dearly love to get his hands on Ivan, I believe that Drakan would also.",
    "I'm going to return to the new base in Burgh de Rott. That will be our best plan for the time being. From there, we may be able to plunge further into the darkness of Morytania and reveal the true horror of what has befallen the peoples of our land.",
    "Thanks for getting Ivan to the temple and letting Polmafi and Radigad know about the new base. Remember, if you get any information about Ivandis, please let me know.",
    "I can give you no specifics my friend. All around us are details of historical importance, any of which might lead us to a significant advantage in our struggle against Drakan. Always be hopeful, always keep your wits about you and double check anything which you think might be important.",
    "You may like to check with Drezel, though I know he isn't keen on discussing such issues. He firmly believes what he's been told by his fellow priests and so I doubt you'll have much luck in gaining information from him.",
    "Ivandis was a priestly warrior, somehow he found a way, along with six others, to fight against the evil that was spewing forth from Morytania. He held aloft a great rod of power which rendered the being useless and lame for a short period. There are stories that he did something else but he is credited with the restoring of what is called, 'Guthix balance'.",
    "That is my interpretation on the meaning of it. Guthix will try to restore power in which ever way he can. He will certainly fight the minions of Zamorak if they trespass into Saradomins land, however, he will also battle Saradomins[sic] forces should they be gaining in Zamoraks[sic] land. Since the time of the god wars Guthix has sought peace and fights to maintain a balance. Guthix doesn't see that Drakan is evil, or that the Myreque are good. He just sees two sides of opposed forces trying to outdo the other one.",
    "That doesn't surprise me at all my friend. On matters such as this you'll find him incredibly stubborn. However, he is still probably the most likely person to know something about Ivandis and the not so well known history of Morytania.",
    "Thanks for getting this base dug out, it's really serving our purposes very well. Do you have any information about Ivandis yet?",
    "Oh yes. That's great news.... have you had a good look around? Did you find anything interesting? If so, please show it to me, I'd be very grateful to read anything which might related[sic] to Ivandis.",
    "Of course not! I would be there now wouldn't I?",
    "Oh, I see what you're asking now. Sorry my friend, I've explored for it extensively and still haven't found it's[sic] whereabouts. Though I would suggest that it wouldn't be too far from the temple. Even an enthusiastic fighter like Ivandis wouldn't forget that tactically he would be outnumbered if he pressed too deeply into Morytania.",
    "Hey there, how's it going?",
    "That's great news... where did you find it? Oh never mind, did you find anything useful? If so show it to me won't you?",
    "The main thing should be the rod which he used to combat the evil minions. Perhaps it has some effect on the vampyres.",
    "Perhaps it's fate that we're not supposed to gain the Rod of Ivandis, if so then our destiny is cast! It's such a pity that we cannot break the mould of our historical defeats and take the fight to Drakan.",
    "Truly? Are you certain? Tell me more!",
    "How clever you are!",
    "I do not I'm afraid, but perhaps you can get some ideas by researching historical tomes, or even studying the rod itself.",
    "Unfortunately my friend, I do not, I would suggest that some time be spent researching the subject. Perhaps there are some tomes which might point you in the right direction? You could also spend some time studying the rod itself.",
    "Hmm, well it certainly looks very authentic. But there doesn't seem to be any enchantment on the item, either mortal or devine. Perhaps there is a step of the process you have not completed yet?",
    "That's a good question but one I cannot answer directly. Perhaps the secret is lost for all time in the annals of history, in which case, perhaps Drezel will be able to give more help.",
    "Hmm, well it certainly looks very authentic. Ah, I see you have enchanted it already, but there doesn't seem to be any divine blessing on the item. Perhaps there is a step of the process you have not completed yet?",
    "That's a good question but one I cannot answer directly. Perhaps the secret is lost for all time in the annals of history, in which case, perhaps Drezel will be able to give more help.",
    "Hey there, how's it going?",
    "Wow, you'll have to show me that if you ever manage to make one.",
    "Very impressive Player, are you sure you wish to part with it though?",
    "Hmmm, well, I can't take it off your hands while you're still using it. If you want to offer it to me, place it in your inventory.",
    "I...I don't believe it! Could this truly be the Rod as used by Ivandis Seergaze? I do believe it is.",
    "Well, Player, you have certainly excelled yourself in this task. I believe you may be Myreque material even yet.",
    "Very well Player, simply bring me a fully charged rod when you get the opportunity and you'll have my gratitude."

    "Veliaf has asked me to take you to the temple.",
    "Where else might I look for information about Ivandis?",
    "Hmm, yes, well I'm doing that already to be honest. I just wondered if you knew anyone who might actually know something?",
    "What do you know about Ivandis?",
    "You mean that he helped to fight against the evil so that Misthalin could remain in Saradomin's control?",
    "I've been talking to Drezel but he doesn't seem responsive.",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "Yes, it seems to be getting more dangerous in Morytania all the time doesn't it?",
    "It's interesting that you talk about salvation. It appears we may find it in the most unlikely of places. Perhaps even in the history of this rotten land we could find some clue to aid us in our attempts to defeat Lowerniel and his Drakan clan.",
    "Veliaf told me about Ivandis.",
    "But you don't even know what he said about Ivandis?",
    "So, you're sure that Ivandis is buried here then?",
    "So where did this rumour come from then?",
    "What proof do you have that Ivandis is buried here?",
    "So you don't actually know for sure then that he is buried here then?",
    "What do you know about the history of this area?",
    "Have you checked that then, have you seen their remains with your own eyes.",
    "Is there somewhere that I might get more information about Ivandis?",
    "So you have no further information on Ivandis that could possibly help me with my quest? Remember that this could potentially release the poor peoples of Morytania from their ill fated ends.",
    "Will you let me check Ivandis' tomb in this temple?",
    "We need to consider every possible thing which could help us!",
    "Why are you so resistant to talking about history?",
    "I think you're holding something back! We really need all the help we can get!",
    "The lives of those pitiful few left in Morytania could rest on this!",
    "Yes, so would I, so please, please, help me as much as you can.",
    "Very well then, Morytania is lost then to ignorance.",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "I found out some things about Efaritay.",
    "Do you know anything about it?",

    "Ok, thanks.",

    "Thanks for that!",
    "I've lost the key to the library!",
    "I've found a library in the temple.",
    "Do you know where Ivandis tomb might be?",
    "No, I mean just roughly? Is it in the east of Morytania, the west. Do you think it's in Mort'ton, Burgh de Rott...any of these places?",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "I think I've found Ivandis' tomb.",
    "Sure, but I need to ask a few questions first.",
    "What should I be looking for in Ivandis' tomb?",
    "There is only a coffin in there and the rod is fused to the top of it. There doesn't seem to be a way of removing the rod from the coffin lid.",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "I think I've found a way to make the Rod of Ivandis!",
    "I made a clay mould of the rod on Ivandis[sic] coffin!",
    "Do you know which metal is used to make the rod?",
    "Do you know what the rod does?",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "Here you go, I've managed to make the rod that Ivandis used to have.",
    "Where would I find out the process for completing the rod?",
    "Here you go, I've managed to make the rod that Ivandis used to have.",
    "Where would I find out the process for completing the rod?",
    "Here you go...the rod Ivandis used to have.",
    "Well thanks...I think I've found out how to make a rod like Ivandis used to own?",
    "Don't worry, I will!",
    "I have brought you the Rod of Ivandis!",
    "Yes, I've come to give the Rod of Ivandis to you!",
    "Hmm, I'll keep hold of it for the time being.",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "I've lost Gadderanks' Hammer!",
    "Okay, I'll pay 3,000 coins for the hammer.",
    "Why does the hammer cost so much?",

    "I'd go and have a chat with him if I were you.",
    "Hi there...you've done a good job on that general store.",
    "It's looking a lot better now that the general store is fixed up, but it really needs some stock I think...imagine how nice it would be to have a warm fire for a change? I just hope they start to stock some tinderboxes!",
    "Yes, I'd go and finish off that general store if I were you! Go and chat with the store owner.",
    "I thought you were helping out Aurel the store owner? Go and talk to him.",
    "Sure, go ahead.",
    "It's coming together now, the store is looking nicer now that it's been fixed up a bit, but it would be better with some stock in it.",
    "We came over from the Sanguinesti region where we were being farmed as food for the vampyres.",
    "It's to the east of here. The land of Morytania is split in half, one half is undead infested desolate swamp, the other is Sanguinesti. I'm glad that I'm not in Sanguinesti any more!",
    "You could stock the store!",
    "I thought you were helping the store owner stock his store?",
    "Well met indeed!",
    "It's getting to be quite nice now with the general store, but it would be useful to get to use the bank!",
    "We just escaped from the Sanguinesti region! It's a terrible place, separated into two districts. To the north is an area some call 'Darkmeyer', and the south is known as 'Meiyerditch'. For all intents and purposes, anything east of 'Burgh de Rott' is the Sanguinesti region, do not go there my friend.",
    "You need to fix up the bank, the booth looks good now, but the wall could do with patching up.",
    "Hey it's you! You're doing a great job with the town! It's really getting a lot better!",
    "Oh, I think it's going great...we're all so pleased with the work you're doing, but there's still lots left to do.",
    "Well, that bank is all fixed now, but it isn't going to serve people's accounts all on its own. You'll have to recruit someone!",
    "Well met and many felicitous salutations Player! All in the town are much agreed that your efforts in restoring the utilities are most proper and correct.",
    "Oh it's brilliant, but we could really do with somewhere to melt down the local ores, and stand a chance of making our own metal items.",
    "It's simply safer to stay here than to risk going through Mort'ton where those horrible Shades just appear out of nowhere and start eating your soul. Also, those horrible ghasts in Mort Myre would just eat you alive! What a way to go, I know I wouldn't fancy it myself.",
    "You've already done quite a lot and I'm sure that everyone is very pleased with your efforts. But I overheard someone saying how great it would be if the old furnace were up and working again. It seems like quite a big job, so I've no idea if it's even possible.",
    "Well done big shot, the smoke from the furnace attracted Gadderanks and his Juvinate body guards. He's set up a blood tithe station in the general store.",
    "He's a human lackie[sic] for Vanstrom Klause. He wants to become a vampyre like Vanstrom. He goes around with his juvinate body guards because he's too weak to defend himself. He gets blood tithes from the locals and takes them back to the vampyres.",
    "A juvinate is an immature form of vampyre. They have total immunity to all known weapon types, and some say they can fly as well. There is a form of the vampyre before this called a Juvenile. A juvinate is an 'initiated juvenile'. They're pretty tough, I have to say, no one that I have seen has ever gotten the better of one.",
    "If I were you, I'd get out of town...now Gadderanks is here, I doubt many people will stay around! Most will try to hide and stay away from him and his blood tithe station. Do you know he's set it up in the general store!",
    "Hey it's the hero! Wow, you're amazing! How on earth did you manage to tackle those two juvinates and Gadderanks? And the town is lovely, you've done a great job.",
    "It's just perfect, thanks so much for your efforts.",
    "Oh, not much really, we're all still hiding from the vampyres and eking out a living from this terrible place, hopefully soon we'll be strong enough to make the journey to the temple on the Salve.",
    "Not as far as I know, we have some basic amenities now which is so very useful, we're all incredibly grateful to you. I've never really seen or known a hero before, so I have nothing to compare one to, but I suspect in most people's judgement, you would be one! I for one am very pleased to have met you."

    "I thought you were fixing up my general store? First fix the roof, then the walls. After that, come and have a chat with me.",
    "I'm sorry my friend, but I cannot open a store which has no stock.",
    "Hi there...you've done a good job on my store! It's starting to look great!",

    "Yes, finish off the general store! Get me some stock!",
    "You could stock the store for us, we'd really start being like a new town then.",
    "Ok, I need 3 Tinderboxes, 10 [Mackerel/raw snails of any type], and 10 Bronze hatchets.",
    "There you go, fill that up for me please.",
    "Sure, go ahead.",

    "It's a lot better now that we have a general store, you're doing a great job! What a hero!",

    "Hey there! Gadderanks dropped this warhammer, I guess it belongs to you now!",
    "Hmm, how careless of you! However, you're in luck! Someone found it earlier and sold it to me, now I can pass the hammer back to you for the remarkably cheap price of 3,000 gold coins. Deal?",
    "A good deal and I'm sure of it!",
    "Thanks for you[sic] business sir!",
    "So much!  That's cheap!  The adventurer I bought it from wanted twice as much but I managed to knock him down to a reasonable price. I had a feeling you might like the item back so I traded what I could to get the item and hold it for ya. If you don't want it, I can just as easily trade it to the many other adventurers that frequent my premises.",
    "Very good then! I'll have no guilty conscience in offering it to other adventurers that frequent my shop then. Many thanks for your time and good day to ya sir.",

I bet you could pay twice as much as the others before passing out...they all do you know!",

    "I would do all I could to help those...",
    "Very well, but there is only so much I can do...I am still a priest of Saradomin remember. I know not if this will help, but please take this key, it will allow you access to a secret library. In there you may find what you're looking for, but I pray you never reveal this to me.",
