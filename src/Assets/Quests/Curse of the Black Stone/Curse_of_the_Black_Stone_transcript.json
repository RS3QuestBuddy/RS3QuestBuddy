    "Hello there, Player. Do you want to trade?",
    "Player I was hoping I would bump into you. I have a bit of a problem and let's face it, when there's a problem you're the person to seek out. I'm not going to sugar coat it. It's the end of the world. Or at least it will be if we don't stop it. You've probably felt it. The chill in the air. The shadows seeming to choke the light more than usual. I have a network of informants around the place looking out for strange portents and omens, you know, signs that something bad is going down. Well one of them has found something. Something big. Something apocalyptically big. Can you help me get to the bottom of this?",
    "Well, maybe when you've got some time spare. I mean it's only the end of the world, I'm sure it will wait...",
    "Great. It's big, this. Even the Fremennik can't ignore the omens. The world itself is trembling in fear, you can feel it if you're really still. Bad stuff. But I'm no expert, you need my informant for that. Unfortunately... My informant is a mysterious resident of the Arc. I have only ever spoken to them via letter and carrier seagull, never directly. They call themselves the 'Jade Spider' and...Well this is the strange part...They've asked for you by name. They're in hiding at the moment, apparently they've picked up some enemies along the way. All we know is that they're on the Arc somewhere currently. You'll have to hunt down clues as to where they might be. Start on Waiko, that's your best bet. Everyone goes through Waiko at some point, so someone may have heard something.",

    "Hello there, Player. Do you want to trade?",
    "Keep following the clues, they'll lead you to where the Jade Spider is hiding. I'm afraid you know as much as I do.",
    "Hello there, Player. Do you want to trade?",
    "So the Jade Spider is Madame Shih, the mysterious pirate of the Eastern Lands? That's awesome! I'm working with a pirate queen! You should probably talk to her about what to do next though. She's probably waiting for you on Goshima.",
    "Hello there, Player. Do you want to trade?",
    "I knew that place was weird. You should speak to Madame Shih to see what needs to happen next.",
    "Hello there, Player. Do you want to trade?",
    "Sorry, I don't speak dragonkin. There's that lovely old dragon down in the museum in Varrock, maybe he can help?",
    "Hello there, Player. Do you want to trade?",
    "I had heard this place was built on top of ancient dragonkin structures, but I've not seen any way inside myself. There's a fountain that's been in the ruins since forever, looks older than some of the other stuff. Might be a good place to start?",
    "Hello there, Player. Do you want to trade?",
    "I think you should talk to your scaley little dragonrider friend, Hannibus, he knows more than me at this point.",
    "Hello there, Player. Do you want to trade?",
    "An abandoned laboratory in the middle of the wilderness...that sounds safe. So very very safe.. Well, we need everything we can find if we're going to stop this Ambassador. You're going to have to investigate that laboratory. It's going to be dangerous. There's going to be dragons. Monstrous beasts. Probably fire and lava...",
    "Ha! It would be glorious. But no, this is one for the World Guardian I fear.",
    "What is that stuff? It seems to be the source of all this strangeness. Come on. We should go and catch up with Madame Shih, she's the mystic pirate type, maybe she knows more. There has to be a connection between these dungeons. The presence of that black stone is too much of a coincidence.",
    "Good luck. Try not to die.",
    "Hello there, Player. Do you want to trade?",
    "They made a dragon out of that stuff? Are they completely mad? There's no time, you need to go and tell Madame Shih about this. That black stone stuff is definitely bad news and she said there's more going on.",
    "Hello there, Player. Do you want to trade?",
    "Each person here is committed to helping us take down the Ambassador. I heard about what the Ambassador did to Shih's crew...we...we have to stop him. NOW! But he's not alone. He has entire legions of crassians and undead things defending his base. He'll destroy us before we even reach him. I've gathered everyone around and set up a war council. We're going to bring the fight to him!",
    "Each person here is committed to helping us take down the Ambassador. First our intel tells us the Ambassador's ritual site is under the ocean, so you're going to need to find a way to breathe underwater. There's a hydromancer, Myrtle, who should be able to help you out.",

First our intel tells us the Ambassador's ritual site is under the ocean, so you're going to need to find a way to breathe underwater. There's a hydromancer, Myrtle, who should be able to help you out. She should be hanging out outside of the Wizard's Tower near Draynor village.",
    "Hello there, Player. Do you want to trade?",
    "You should speak to Hannibus, he has some tasks which he needs help with.",
    "Excellent stuff. Next on our list, we're going to need to find some way of clearing out the Ambassador's artillery. Currently his cannons can take out our boats long before we reach him. We're going to need to get rid of them. Fortunately, our scaly friend Hannibus here has a plan.",
    "Hello there, Player. Do you want to trade?",
    "You should speak to Quartermaster Gully, he has some issues to resolve with Steven.",
    "So there are two of them? Yay? Well those cannons are doomed. But before we move on, your quartermaster has a bit of a personal request. You should have a bit of a chat with him.",
    "You should chat with Gully.",
    "Hello there, Player. Do you want to trade?",
    "You should speak to Bosun Higgs, she has some unfinished business she wants to finish before leaving for the reef.",
    "Excellent work mending a seagull marriage there. Right, there's one last thing left to do. Talk to the bosun, she has all the details.",
    "Speak to the bosun, she's got this stage worked out.",
    "Hello there, Player. Do you want to trade?",
    "Everyone is ready to take the fight to the Ambassador, we leave on your command Captain.",
    "Okay, that should be it. We've got an army, a couple of dragons, can breathe underwater and a seagull's marriage has been repaired. There's only one thing left boss...your speech.",
    "We're about to head to our possible deaths, you've got to have a motivational speech for everyone!",
    "... ...[sic] Right the ruddy World Guardian has already stopped the ritual and neglected to tell us until now. Everyone go away.",
    "Take the boat to the Shadow Reef, we've got your back.",
    "Take the boat to the Shadow Reef, we've got your back.",
    "You've done it! The Ambassador is dead!",
    "You're amazing, anyone ever tell you that?",
    "Well then. We've saved the world, but the world is always going to need saving. You did good Player, you did good. Have a drink on me.",
    "Hello there, Player. Do you want to trade?",
    "Glad we took down that Ambassador and his sinister ritual. I don't particularly want to live in a horrific ocean-nightmarescape for the rest of my life."

    "There's something odd about this statue. It has two oval indentations where the eyes should be.",

    "So you can read this?",
    "We're looking for another tablet piece, let's take a look around.",

    "Hello little spider.",
    "No one ever wants to talk to me.",

    "There are eggs just there, look, in the flames.",
    "I don't think this is getting me anywhere.",
    "I...Maybe we should talk about something else.",
    "Wow, that's a long way down. I can just about see some water down there, but who knows what else is at the bottom.",
    "Hrmm, imperfect metal when cooled quickly can become really brittle. I could perhaps use that to help me break this metal casing.",
    "I sometimes wonder why I do dumb things?",
    "That would be awfully convenient, almost implausible.",
    "Okay, now we just need to break it on something.",
    "Okay. Those teeth look sturdy and sharp, I could probably break off the brittle metal in them.",
    "Okay, let's head there and check it out.",
    "Hey there Mr. dragon head thing.",
    "I really hope you are just a statue and not secretly part of some giant stone dragon.",
    "What a creepy looking statue.",
    "Aargh it talks!",
    "AAAAAAARGH!",
    "I'm looking for clues.",
    "Well, yes actually. I was hoping we might be able to find more information on a dragonkin laboratory somewhere.",
    "Any idea how we might follow them?",
    "Statues, fantastic. I'll take a look. Thanks.",
    "I am a dragonkin in disguise!",
    "I did not.",
    "But you're just stuck on this shelf?",
    "I'm glad you're so happy.",
    "That's not the normal response in these interactions.",

    "I should go and check in with Bryll before I head into the dungeon.",
    "Are you sure you don't want to go?",
    "Actually...I've already fought my way through that laboratory and defeated the Black Stone dragon that guards it. It seems like the dragon was suffering the same way that Seiryu was. Something corrupting it. It all seemed to be linked to that black stone.",
    "Looks like I'm fighting my way through a dangerous dragonkin laboratory. What could go wrong?",
    "I have defeated the Black Stone Dragon inside the Dragonkin Laboratory. It seemed to be at war with itself somehow.",
    "I'm sorry. So sorry. We'll regroup and work out a...",
    "Don't be crazy, we don't know what we're up against, we need to be smart about this.",
    "I should go and talk with Bryll, we need to do this fight properly.",
    "Hello there.",
    "I don't suppose I could trouble you for some help with a water-based problem.",
    "You wouldn't know a way I could breathe underwater...way out in the Cursed Archipelago?",
    "Excellent.",
    "Oh.",
    "Do you have any other ideas?",
    "Sounds like it could be just what I was looking for.",
    "Of course there is. What is it? Will I need to go find the ingredients from far flung corners of the world?",
    "It's a bit too deep and far out to sea to fish with a net or rod.",
    "I'm not sure where to fill the vial",
    "I'm not sure where to dry the seaweed.",
    "So about that fish...",
    "Goodbye.",
    "Okay, I am now fully capable of breathing underwater for a few hours.",
    "So we're looking for an expert on dragon activity on Gielinor?",
    "With Vindicta and Gorvek we have enough to destroy the cannons, we should head back to base.",
    "Yup.",
    "Err...yep.",
    "That seems simple enough.",
    "Hello Mrs Steven. Is everything ok?",
    "I know that voice.",
    "I don't believe that for a minute count. Come on Steven, I'm sure we can save your marriage. Maybe we can speak to someone else on the island who can help?",
    "I should gather more proof against the Count before I try and fix their marriage.",
    "Hi, I don't suppose you would know anything about Count Ludwig Koppenploppen?",
    "About a month?",
    "Well, it is a rather nice view. Better than the one from my house anyway.",
    "Hi, I don't suppose you would know anything about Count Ludwig Koppenploppen?",
    "Wait what, but he's seeing someone else?[sic]",
    "Hi, I don't suppose you would know anything about Count Ludwig Koppenploppen?",
    "Hi, I don't suppose you would know anything about Count Ludwig Koppenploppen?",
    "The horror!",
    "Hi, I don't suppose you would know anything about Count Ludwig Koppenploppen?",
    "Hi, I don't suppose you would know anything about Count Ludwig Koppenploppen?",
    "That's horrible, how?",
    "Pretty easily actually...",
    "That sounds like more than enough evidence to show Mrs Steven why the Count isn't the right gull for her. I should go and speak to Steven.",
    "Hello. Wait! Haven't I talked to you already?",
    "Mrs Steven, the Count is a bounder and a cad and I have proof!",
    "So you cool to maybe die for me now?",
    "I'll go and speak to Lieutenant Crane then.",
    "Evie sent me.",
    "She's alright, she's part of my crew. We're about to face a really powerful enemy and she suggested you as someone who might be able to help.",
    "The fate of Gielinor is at stake.",
    "This one's a mutated dragonkin with an army of undead minions, about to complete a ritual which will summon a powerful evil force and wipe out all life on Gielinor.",
    "So you'll join us?",
    "What do you need?",
    "Ok, if I go and check on your sister you'll join the fight?",
    "Just try it, I dare you.",
    "I'm sorry...but have you considered...",
    "During mating season!",
    "I have. She wants me to find her sister before coming to help us. She's in the Black Knight's fortress. I was just wondering what the best way to sneak into the Fortress might be.",
    "I am looking for a trainee, going by the name of Tessa.",
    "What would have happened to her if she was?",
    "I mean where would she be if she failed!",
    "Yes, let me see transfers.",
    "Do you know where Tessa's stuff is?",
    "Right keep on it, there could be infiltrators and spies anywhere!",
    "Where would trainee Tessa's stuff be?",
    "Right keep on it, there could be infiltrators and spies anywhere!",
    "What on Gielinor?",
    "Whahah!?! Who is going to be upset?",
    "How is a suit of armour talking?",
    "I'm meant to be talking. Suits of armour generally don't.",
    "...Anyway, I'm looking for Tessa too, have you seen her?",
    "Don't worry my sentient helm-friend! I'll find her, hopefully she'll be promoted and have all brand-new armour...",
    "I'll let you know if anything comes up!",
    "I'll let you know if anything comes up!",
    "Are you Tessa?",
    "What are you doing here? Weren't you supposed to be training to be a black knight?",
    "What are you doing here? Weren't you supposed to be training to be a black knight?",
    "Err... ok?",
    "Why didn't you just tell me this?",
    "That could be problematic, I will go talk to your sister. Just hang tight for now ok.[sic]",
    "She's a slave. I'm sorry. Commandant Bletchley had all the women kicked out and then turned into slaves. They...they cut out her tongue.",
    "She's fine. She says that you should come and fight with us now.",
    "Ummm, well...",
    "She's fine. She says that you should come and fight with us now.",
    "I'll get right back on that.",
    "Are you aware of what has been going on at the Black Knight's Fortress under Commandant Bletchley?",
    "I need your help. We are breaking Tessa out of here!",
    "The commandant failed her, enslaved her and cut out her tongue...",
    "You are going to help sneak her out! You'd make an excellent disguise.",
    "About that...Tessa has had her tongue removed and has been forced into slavery. We are busting her out, and you are going to have to be her voice. So now all we'll have to do...",
    "NO CODENAMES. Just follow me and we will be out of here in no time!",
    "Lieutenant...",
    "Dare I ask, Lieutenant, why you are bothering to ask me again about who I bring in and out of the castle?",
    "I find your lack of faith in me disturbing. Your paranoia and cowardice evident as much as when I detained Sir Owen.",
    "Perhaps I should tell Commandant Bletchley of your behaviour, as it is quite unbecoming of a black knight?",
    "We were requested by Lieutenant Crane, as she needs our help in the Taverley Dungeon.",
    "We were supposed to be relieved of duty several hours ago. We are meeting some friends for drinks at the pub?",
    "Er...",
    "Not yet. I did smuggle out her sister though!",
    "What will be doing next?",
    "I almost have obtained Crane's Assistance[sic]! But she needs your help. She wants us to deal with the commandant.",
    "How do you think we should do it? I highly doubt Bletchley is just going to let us murder him discreetely in one of the most fortified citadels in Gielinor...",
    "He seems to think quite highly of himself.",
    "Maybe I could lure him by saying that I've spotted you sneaking into the castle on the roof. We can ambush him, with Crane's assistance and finish him there.",
    "You should go to the roof!",
    "The deserter Higgs is up there! Should I send for more guards?",
    "As you once said, 'We have to separate the calf from the veal'!",
    "I should go and talk to Bryll for the next part of the plan.",
    "My what now?",
    "Yeah...about that. I've sort of already done the dungeon. I've already stopped the Ambassador...I did it earlier.",
    "The Ambassador is one of the greatest threats that Gielinor has ever faced.",
    "His ritual, should it succeed, will bring down a dark force which will consume the world.",
    "I've witnessed first-hand the influence of this evil. It warps, corrupts and destroys everything it touches.",
    "It warps our protectors and turns them against us.",
    "All that stands between the destruction of everything we know, is us.",
    "Why is the Ambassador resistant to damage?",
    "He has diplomatic immunity!",
    "Well I thought it was funny.",
    "Never have I seen such a gathering of amazing people.",
    "We have warriors capable of taking on armies.",
    "Sailors capable of outmaneuvering the fastest vessels.",
    "And great dragons capable of incinerating anyone that stands in our way!",
    "The Ambassador doesn't stand a chance!",
    "Each of us is different. Few of us would perhaps have chosen to join together under normal circumstances.",
    "But these are not normal circumstances.",
    "But our differences are our strength. We each have skills and abilities that compliment[sic] one another.",
    "Together there's nothing that can stop us.",
    "It won't be easy. But each of us knows our role to play.",
    "I know none of you will let me down.",
    "So let's do this. Time to save the world.",
    "Look at the person next to you. We're more alike than we are different.",
    "Each person here is risking their life to save their neighbour.",
    "Risking everything to save the world.",
    "I am proud to stand amongst you, because united there is nothing that can stand against us.",
    "It won't be easy. But each of us knows our role to play.",
    "I know none of you will let me down.",
    "So let's do this. Time to save the world.",
    "The Ambassador thinks he's strong. But he's wet and limp as the seaweed that clings to him.",
    "His followers are mindless crabs, brainwashed cultists and decomposing pirates.",
    "And he thinks, for a moment, that he can stand up to us?",
    "We're going to show him how very wrong he is.",
    "It won't be easy. But each of us knows our role to play.",
    "I know none of you will let me down.",
    "So let's do this. Time to save the world.",
    "And his ritual dead with him.",
    "Nowhere near enough...",

    "Hello Player, I'm glad you found me. I was beginning to wonder if you would be able to make it at all.",
    "The very same. It's a bit of a dramatic title, but it has its uses. People tend to be oddly frightened of strange names, puts the riff-raff off. But whilst I'd love to chit-chat, I'm afraid we've just not got the time. I take it Bryll has warned you about a rising threat?",
    "Yes, well, the world is full of theatre I'm afraid. I find it better to embrace it than to run from it.",
    "There is a being called the Ambassador. He is an ancient creature in service to something dark and terrible. I've been investigating him for some time and I think I've finally found a lead on him. There is a new religious order that has grown on the island of Aminishi. They preach purity and transcendence, but the truth is far far darker than that. I managed to sneak inside, pretended to be one of the faithful, and I rose high enough to join their council. That's when I learned they were dealing with the black stone. Something I have dealt with in the past and it's bad news. Whatever this stone touches, it corrupts and I could already see the tendrils of corruption infesting the Temple of Aminishi. Unfortunately I got careless and someone learned that I wasn't truly faithful. I killed them before they could tell anyone, but it's too risky for me to stay there now. I know that suspicion is creeping in on me. Which is why I need you. See I'm good at warding magic and they used my skills to protect their dungeon from intruders. But what they don't know is that I added a backdoor to the wards. I tied the magic of the wards to the nearby guards so that someone with a powerful enough magical presence...say the World Guardian...would be able to break the wards just by taking out some of the security. Crude, but effective. So that's what I need you to do. I need you to make your way into the Temple of Aminishi and find out what they're doing in the lower levels. You don't need to do it alone, if you've got some friends you can trust, they can join the fight with you. It won't be an easy fight, but you're the World Guardian, I'm sure you can handle it.",
    "...",
    "You need to investigate the Temple of Aminishi and learn its secrets.",
    "...",
    "SEIRYU! ONE OF THE SACRED ANIMA GUARDIANS! HOW DARE THEY!",
    "But...it makes sense and seems to tie in with something my agents have recently uncovered. A strange tablet buried in the sands of Aminishi. It seems that the black stone is not a recent discovery. In fact it was discovered a long time ago. At least that's as much as we can glean from this tablet. According to my mystics it's written in the language of a race, from the distant past, known as the dragonkin. Nasty creatures if the stories are to be believed.",
    "I need to stay here and see if I can discover anything more about this Ambassador and his plans. I imagine someone as well travelled as you must know someone who knows a lot about dragonkin. They might be able to help.",
    "You'll need to find an expert on the dragonkin to translate that tablet for you.",
    "Never! I will never surrender myself to that...that...thing!",
    "What? NO!",
    "I'll kill you! I'll stop your ritual and tear your heart out of your chest!",

    "No. No more waiting. No more debating. I have nothing left to lose. All I have left is my vengeance. I will tear apart this ritual with my bare hands. He will regret the day he ever crossed me.",
    "You...you did it. You avenged my crew...I...thank you Player, thank you.",
    "I went to fight him. Like a fool. I went to fight him. But his forces caught me. He had wormed his way into my head. Some time ago, back when Rabid Jack took me hostage in that temple. Like Seiryu I could only feel a terrible obsession, a desperate yearning need to hunt him down. He was counting on that of course. I should have known better, but...the noise was so loud. That horrible song screaming in my head. But it's silent now. Silent enough that I could escape. Silent enough that I could return here and thank you. I owe you a great debt Player and one day I look forward to repaying it."

    "By jove, this really is quite the find. This seems to be some sort of map, though I cannot quite make it out. It's talking about a font of creation. Which knowing what I know of the dragonkin might well indicate one of their hidden laboratories.",
    "Ah, well that's where we hit a bit of a problem. It seems this is only a part of the map. Not enough to create a full picture. It's not all doom and gloom though. No no. In fact it talks about where the first clue might be hidden, or at least a link to it. It mentions that it's being safeguarded by the white-scaled alchemist. Does that ring a bell? It does mention something about a cold frozen mountain to the north, along the north east of the continent. A secret sanctum deep beneath the ground. Perhaps you can find something there?",
    "How may I be of service?",
    "Why...no...it couldn't be...could it? A living, breathing, dragonrider, here in my little office? My good sir, it is an honour to meet you. Truly. Why I am quite giddy, where's a parchment, I really must get your signature.",
    "Oh my stars yes. To us dragons, you dragonriders are...are...well you're like heroes to us. To most of my kind your touch is a sparkling moment of lucidity in an endless nightmare. Why dragons dream of finding a rider. Of learning how to feel the wind beneath their wings without the rage stripping away the ability to enjoy the moment. And then there's the history! The stories, the LEGENDS...I would love to pick your brains, to learn everything there is to learn about you.",
    "Hrmm. I'm sorry I can't think of any dragons with enough clarity to join you.",

    "The seeds of a future. A cure...or the beginnings of one. Kerapac left me with a typically succinct note. It's not a full cure, but it will help some of the younger generation to produce healthy young. It won't save us, but it will save enough that there's now a real chance of us finding a solution. So, I had to find him, to thank him. But he seems to have vanished off the face of the planet. In typical Kerapac fashion.",
    "I was. It was beautiful seeing them all again. Sad, or course, we are a reduced people, barely a handful left. But sad can be beautiful and whilst we may be few, we are far from alone. But then he found me, Karapac. He seemed...distracted, but he wanted to give me something.",
    "A...a...cure. Well not a cure, but a salve. It won't save us, but it's the beginning of something. The spark of hope just handed to me. But you know Kerapac, man of few words, he left before I could find out anything more. I travelled across worlds to seek him out, see if I could learn more. Happily that seemed to coincide with our reunion. It is good to see you my friend.",
    "I've been searching this lab since I got here and I can't find anything concrete. Just this piece of some soft of ancient map, but it's gibberish. I can't make heads nor tails of it.",
    "Wait! I recognise that. It's the language of the dragons, or a crude attempt at it at least.",
    "When they are calm, they can be quite intelligent. I've only ever been able to calm a dragon whilst I am in its presence though, but Shakorexis introduced me to the basics of their culture and their language. It's a simple language, it conveys emotions more than words. They're creatures of experiences, dragons, their entire lives are built around the few memories of lucid moments. It's sad really, they are such wonderful friends when the rage doesn't take them over.",
    "Just about. It wasn't written by a dragon, that much I can tell you. It's like someone used the language as part of some sort of code, or puzzle. Ignoring the beauty of a language so that they could get across some crude directions. It talks about secrets hidden in the place where 'the armoured dragons are made'. Though I'm not sure where that might be.",
    "We should search for the place where 'the armoured dragons are made'. Wherever that might be.",
    "This place...by the Olun'dai this place is horrible. Do you feel it? So much pain. So much suffering. A horrible burning sensation creeping over my skin. An aura of terrible loss. Let's get what we need and get out of here. This is an evil place.",
    "We should look around the place. This is where the tablet hinted earlier, there must be another clue hidden somewhere.",
    "That lump of metal could be what we're after, if only we could find a way to melt it off or something.",
    "Well that metal is nice and hot now, but it's not sliding off the thing. I'm no smith, but perhaps there's something we can do to make it brittle.",
    "It's brittle, now all we need is a sharp solid point to break it over.",
    "I still can't decypher it. But there's a drawing of something that looks familiar. I think I saw it back at the lab in Daemonheim.",
    "They're beautiful creatures, much smarter than they appear. But they're afflicted with a terrible, constant rage. They call it the 'maker's curse' and believe it is something from their creator that has afflicted them. The horrible reality is that they can never be more than mindless beasts as long as the rage afflicts them. But we ilujanka have a power, the ability to calm a dragon. To let it be rational for a while. We take some of their fury and siphon it away, give them some of our own calm and clarity. They're so kind, so friendly, so full of promise when they're like that. They let us ride them, rider and dragon together. To fly on a dragon is an experience like no other. The wind against our scales. The world falling away below us. It's amazing.",
    "My world is beautiful and my people are part of that. We live in harmony with the planet, working with the animals there to tend to the planet. My people believe every living thing is a part of a shared destiny, a tapestry made up of countless threads. We call it the Olun'dai. But we are dying. The population falls further and further each generation with fewer young born healthy. It won't be long until we cannot sustain a viable population. It's terrible to realise that your species is on the endangered list. But this serum that Kerapac has given me. It's a ray of hope. Not a cure, but it gives us the most amazing gift of all. The only thing worth having. Time.",
    "I shall try.",
    "The...rage...it's so strong. By the Olun'dai she's so angry...",
    "It's...difficult. She is in so much pain. She has no voice of her own, so I'm lending her mine.",
    "She's not listening. You'll need to try and reach her.",
    "Yes, because that always works.",
    "She's not listening. You'll need to try and reach her.",

    "I'm sorry, Player, I can't bare it. Ask her something else, please. She's so scared, so sad.",
    "Have a heart Player, you can't feel it. These poor creatures are in so much pain and their minds are clouded constantly with anger. They barely know who they are. Treat them with a little respect.",
    "Rest my friend.",
    "Maybe there's another one buried bit deeper into the dragon head.",
    "Life is constantly implausible my friend. That's what makes it wonderful.",
    "Sounds like a plan.",
    "I can see the tablet. Let me take a look. You're not going to like this...it looks like it's sending us in circles. I still can't decipher it. But there's a drawing of something that looks familiar. I think I saw it back at the lab in Daemonheim.",
    "So here we are again. This is definitely where the tablet was pointing to. We'll have to look around, see if there are any more clues.",
    "This is definitely the place the tablet mentioned. There must be a clue here somewhere. I'll look over here, you try some of the other rooms.",
    "Well...that strange little effigy thing mentioned something to do with the statues. Perhaps there's a trick to it?",
    "We should head through that portal.",
    "You should go speak to Kerapac, if anyone can translate that tablet, it's him.",
    "You should go and catch up with Bryll. Kerapac and I have a lot to talk about.",
    "You should talk to Bryll first, breathing underwater is probably more important than my plan.",
    "Well the big disadvantage that these cannons have, is that they're rather vulnerable from the air. So I thought that I could perhaps convince a few of our big scaly friends to help us out. I thought we might start by chatting with my old mount, Shakorexis, or the King Black Dragon as you call him. It would be good to fly again.",
    "Now that you can breath underwater we should probably move on to the next stage. Unfortunately for us the Ambassador isn't stupid and he's defended his ritual site fairly well. Our immediate priority is going to be taking out his artillery. Fortunately his cannons are all facing decidedly downwards. A quick strike with dragonfire and those cannons will go up in smoke. I thought we might go and visit my old friend Shakorexis, or as you know him, the King Black Dragon. It will be good to see my old friend again.",
    "Hello old friend. It's been too long.",
    "There is hope, old friend. Hope. But I am not here to reminisce, I need your help.",
    "Are there any others who could join us? Dragons with enough self control?",
    "It is time we spoke with our good friend Mordaut. Shakorexis, we are gathering on the east of Daemonheim, will you meet us there?",
    "You s hould talk to Hannibus about taking out those cannons.",
    "We need to speak to an expert on dragons.",
    "My signature?",
    "I would be delighted. But perhaps not now. I'm looking for dragons that could join us in a great battle. A dragon with enough clarity that they could help me without me needing to ride them.",
    "I see. Well...thank you for your...",
    "Other...rider?",
    "I...Player please, I need to meet this rider. I need to speak with them.",
    "Thank you for your time Mr Mordaut, I shall have to see about a longer conversation later.",
    "I shall meet you at the Heart, Player.",
    "We need to visit the Heart. I can't believe it, another dragonrider!",
    "Well met my friend. To see another ilujanka here, on Gielinor and to see you riding a dragon as I once did.",
    "That is true. All the ilujanka are on Iaia currently.",
    "No. It's more than that. They serve the Olun'dai. They serve their place in the tapestry.",

We must make sure that no chain can ever be forged again. So once again I raise the old banner and I ask you to stand with me my brothers and sisters.
