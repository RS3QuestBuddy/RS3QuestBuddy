    "Adventurer you must hurry! You have freed the members of the secret council, but we must ensure that the Culinaromancer is defeated once and for all!",
    "Follow him into the portal and make sure he never leaves again!",
    "[Player], I must warn you: inside that dimension you will have no assistance from the gods and your prayers will not work at all!",
    "Also, be aware that he will use his powers to draw upon the might of foes you have fought before.",
    "Take care, I suspect the Culinaromancer will not give up so easily.",
    "Good work [Player]! I think that will be the last we'll see of him! You'd better come back now."

    "Oh MAN! That was AWESOME!",
    "After you managed to save all of the members of the secret council with those weird foods, the culinaromancer tried to make a run for it, but you followed him into his magic portal and Biff! Bang! Boom! sorted him out once and for all!",
    "Did you ever know that you're my hero?",
    "Did you want a reminder of any other of your brave exploits?",
    "Seriously, you were great! I can't believe I nearly caused all of those people to be killed!",
    "You really got my bacon out of the fire there!",
    "Ooh dear, yes I do! It's the Duke of Lumbridge's birthday today, and I need to bake him a cake!",
    "I need you to bring me some eggs, some flour, some milk and a chocolate bar...",
    "Nah, not really, I'm just messing with you! Thanks for all your help, I know I can count on you again in the future!",
    "You mean you didn't check it out yet?",
    "I really think you should, it seems to be some kind of magical cooking chest, I found a bunch of food in it earlier, along with a bunch of weird looking kitchen equipment and some snazzy gloves!"
