  "Ariane": [
    "You are not getting away with this.",
    "Drop it? You stole vital research, Xenia. And you killed a man!",
    "Childish morality? He was a good man, Xenia! You were at his wedding!",
    "I shall not!",
    "What are you doing?",
    "You stole vital research... and you killed Corvusa! I'm not letting you go anywhere, Xenia!",
    "You stole vital research from me! You killed Corvusa! How is that for the greater good?",
    "You can't explain this! You stole my research! And you killed Corvusa!",
    "How dare you? How dare you think that? He was my friend!",
    "Once Xenia's in custody I'll be happy to talk it over.",
    "What work, Xenia? What? What is so important that it warrants killing a good man and stealing my research?",
    "I've seen how this fight plays out, Xenia. Trust me - you don't want it.",
    "What? No! That was one time!",
    "How did this suddenly become me under interrogation? Xenia stole my research... And she MURDERED SOMEONE!",
    "Don't you dare try to turn this into a joke, Xenia! You stole my research! Months of work! And you killed Corvusa!",
    "** (If you sided with her). Thank you for your support, Player. I know it must have been tough standing up to Xenia and I do appreciate it. She's clearly out of her mind at the moment, dangerously so. It's vital that we track her down and work out what she's up to.",
    "Player, allow me to introduce you to the Kinaesthetic Investigation Programmable Personality Lifeform Emulator.",
    "This golem has been specially designed to adapt to the challenges presented to it. It learns from experience and its environment - even from audible, tactile and visual input from day-to-day interactions. Really it's quite the marvel of magical engineering. We... erm... call it Kipple for short. Say 'hello,' Kipple.",
    "Oh come on - really? I thought we'd worked that terrible joke subroutine out of you. Anyway, I believe this golem is our best chance of tracking down Xenia. All teleports must leave a magical trace that we can follow. Since all teleports move the caster between different planes. As a normal teleport takes us through the Abyss, whatever teleport she's using must pass through somewhere else. Therefore, it must leave an imprint. This golem can be attuned to follow residual magical trails. We just need to follow Xenia's.",
    "Kipple here can be retuned quite easily. You just need to open him up and see if you can locate the right frequency. Once he's picked up something, he'll show you the signal and you can refine it further. You'll probably need to refine it further by going to the areas he suggests, before you can find Xenia directly. Knowing Xenia, she'll have jumped to several places to throw us off the trail. So we'll have to visit multiple places to work out what it is that she is up to. I'll need to stay here and work out what research she has taken. And to help everyone with the death of Pablo... Wizard Corvusa. When you're ready to proceed, talk to Kipple here.",
    "I genuinely don't know, and that concerns me. Xenia has been an adventurer for longer than I've been alive. Her secrets have secrets. She could be up to anything. But if she's willing to kill over it, then it must be big.",
    "Wizard Pablo Corvusa. A friend of mine and a wizard of the tower. I wish I knew why she did that. He was a good man and I thought they were friends. She was at his wedding... We both were. He wasn't exactly what you'd call an impressive wizard. He knew his spells and his incantations, but he was never going to push the boundaries of arcane theory. He was a good, honest... brave man. Looked out for his friends, stood up against injustice. He deserved better.",
    "She stole quite a lot of research. Various fragments from various tomes and scrolls. Some of it was regarding theories into teleportation - the research I retrieved from the old tower. But some of it was just ramblings from old religious texts and a few cave paintings. Things that had been brought here from other worlds, and then discarded over time. Nothing I can see any immediate use for. But she knew what she was taking, even if I didn't.",
    "The principle is fairly simple, really. When someone teleports, they are doing so by sort of skipping through another plane. The traditional teleport takes us through the Abyss, but there's theoretically no reason we couldn't use another plane. Regardless, the transition leaves a sort of temporary scar in the magical flow of the world. Sort of like a dip, or puddle in a road. Each dip will resonate with a specific magical frequency, and the golem is designed to track that. Think of it as sort of a magical tracker dog. To attune the golem you need to rotate the discs so that the runes line up with the appropriate power values. When the runes are lined up correctly, then the golem can home in on the teleport... erm... puddle. It's tricky, as signals are so specific, but the golem has a handy visual display that should help. When it's discovered a possible signal, it will display the frequency so that you can match up the rune values to the signal. It will need several tunings to get the precise teleport location and each tuning will be more precise than before. But in principle, it's pretty straightforward.",
    "The Kinaesthetic Investigation Programmable Personality Lifeform Emulator - or Kipple for short - is a fantastic piece of magical engineering. It contains a unique apparatus designed to home in on specific magical signals, to the exclusion of other magical noise. Its head contains three discs of carefully carved and infused rune essence. These can be rotated to allow different runes to interact with the magical energy matrix. By analysing the interactions of the energy matrix with the runes, the golem can attune itself to the magical signal it's following, if the runes and signal align. Beyond that, it learns, it's designed to respond to data and improve itself, becoming more efficient as time goes on.",
    "It's not alive, Player. It's a device - a tool. Although... theoretically, maybe. I mean it learns, it adapts, it improves... There's no reason it couldn't develop a personality. Keep an eye on it, Player. See if it does develop a personality. If anyone would notice, it would be you.",
    "Oh no! The evil golem army could rise up and kill us all! Wooooooo! You read too many scary books, Player. I'm ninety-nine percent sure there will be no golem uprising. Okay, maybe eighty-five percent sure.",
    "It was a bit of a joint effort from several wizards - notably members of the Runecrafting Guild. I don't think any one wizard can really take the credit. We all had a hand in this.",
    "I'm still an outcast yes, but I'm not completely ostracised from everyone. I'm still considered to be a bit of a revolutionary thinker in the field of magic and that attracts all sorts. It's how I got to know Pablo... I'll miss him. But yes, I know enough people to be able to get access to Kipple. Especially to help track down Pablo's murderer.",
    "Oh, you know me, Player. We've worked together before. This isn't really the time to be talking about me - not with Xenia still at large. Maybe some other time. Right now, we have more pressing issues at hand.",
    "What choice? What decision? What plan is so terrible that she can't even discuss it with her friends first?",
    "He must have known what you were up to and risked his life to prevent it. Isn't that reason enough to stop?",
    "Stole!",
    "But... but that's madness. The consequences would be...",
    "No, Xenia, you can't do that. If you siphon the Anima Mundi away, you'll be siphoning away magic. Gielinor is built and thrives on magic. So much of the world NEEDS it!",
    "No Xenia, I can't allow this - it's wrong. The world needs magic. We'll find another way.",
    "Thank you, Player. I'm glad you see sense.",
    "Seriously? You don't care about all magic being removed from the world? I never thought you to be so cold, Player.",
    "No! I can't let you do this Xenia! I'll stop you... even if I have to kill you.",
    "...",
    "What is that? Player, distract it and look for a weakness. I'll channel a spell to chip away that armour.",
    "(If you talk to her) We have to find a way to defeat this thing!",
    "Back to the Abyss with you!",
    "Fall creature!",
    "It has no effect!",
    "That... that thing. Some sort of ancient creature from the Abyss. That must have been the creature that Xenia was talking to. Xenia... I'm sorry. No... No, I'm not. She left me with no choice. I had to do it. Thank you, Player, for stopping that thing and for finding Xenia for me. If we hadn't stopped her... Well it doesn't bear thinking about. But it's done now and the world is saved from Xenia's madness. Although the warning that creature gave as it died... perhaps it's too late.",
    "I'm sorry about Kipple. It seemed quite attached to you. Hmm... I may have an idea. Come find me outside the old tower when you have a moment.",
    "You saw her! You heard her! What else could I have done? She left me with no choice... I... I had no choice.",
    "To what end? She wouldn't have listened. She was single-minded - focused on only one solution, regardless of the consequences. (Continues below).",
    "Might have worked. MIGHT! A chance of success, at the very certain cost of losing all magic. Can you imagine a world without magic? It would be horrible. We need magic on Gielinor. (Continues below).",
    "Thank you. Knowing you agree with my actions makes it a little easier to bear. (Continues below).",
    "No, that doesn't really make it forgivable does it? I killed my friend. I had a moment of fury and I just... I struck out. I didn't even hold back. I hit her with a deadly spell and now... she's gone. No. She was going to leave this world a magicless husk. I had no choice.",
    "I'm not going to dwell on this any longer. Xenia made her choice and forced mine. That's all there is to it.",
    "(Same as above).",
    "(Same as above).",
    "Xenia got it into her deluded head that the elder gods could be kept asleep if she siphoned all the Anima Mundi out of the world. Of course, doing so would take all of the magic out of Gielinor, which would obviously be problematic. There's a chance it might have worked, I suppose, but the price was too high. We'll save Gielinor another way.",
    "We weren't able to stop her siphoning some of the Anima Mundi into the Abyss. I don't know what effect that will have, but the abyssal creature we fought implied that it had already started waking the elder gods. If that's the case, we're all in trouble.",
    "Sadly no, not completely. I was able to salvage his... er... heart, I suppose, which contains the personality he developed.",
    "Like Kipple? No... Kipple was unique. We have a few similar learning models, but they don't seem to quite have the spark that Kipple did. Nor would they have his experience.",
    "Now that is a big question. Superficially, we know that they are the creators of Gielinor - likely of everything. As far as we can tell, they shaped the world out of sacred clay and then set in motion the conditions that create life. Enhancing the Anima Mundi, as the gnomes call it, through their ministrations. Quite why I am not certain.",
    "What little I can discover about Bik is that she - if 'she' is the right term - is associated with nature and change. Judging by the unique nature of her creations I'd say she represents some force of transformation or alteration. Going by how you've described her proxy's chamber, I would suggest that she is associated with nature, earth and soil.",
    "All I really know about Ful is that she seems to be strongly associated with fire and lava. I've heard of strange lava creatures in the volcano in Karamja. I imagine they'd have more to say about her. Certainly judging by her violent reaction in the proxy's chamber we can assume she's very hot-headed. Sorry, that was a terrible pun.",
    "From what I know of this elder god, I'm deeply concerned. All references I've had of her seem to involve destruction and the ending of things. Entire civilisations gone, as if they were nothing. But I'm probably overthinking things, after all these sources are fragments of ancient documents, most of which are incomplete or damaged beyond repair. I'm also attempting to translate languages that have been dead for millennia, so make of that what you will.",
    "Now this is a name I have heard of. What we know of Jas is that she is the creator of the single most powerful artefact, currently known, in the universe. The Stone of Jas. Fought over by gods, people trying to be gods and an assortment of powerful and deadly beings. The artefact seems to be a force of evolution and improvement, perhaps symbolising the universal force that Jas herself represents.",
    "I really don't know much about Mah. But given the lack of a proxy, I'm going to assume she never made it to Gielinor. Does that mean that elder gods can die?",
    "Hello, Player. Ah, Player, good to see you. I'm sorry about what happened to Kipple, but my colleagues and I have done some tinkering. It's not a perfect replica. Certainly it's smaller. But it contains the essence of your Kipple... only in miniature form."

    "You don't know what you're getting yourself into. Drop this, Ariane.",
    "If there was an alternative I would have taken it, but this goes beyond childish notions of morality.",
    "And that makes what I had to do all the more heartbreaking, but no less necessary. I understand your frustration, Ariane, and if I had time I'd feel sorry. But right now I simply don't have time for guilt or sympathy. Ariane, you will let me pass.",
    "Then you leave me no choice.",
    "What must be done. I'm sorry, Ariane, truly I am.",
    "There's no time! No time to deliberate, no time for diplomacy. Each moment that we waste is another step closer to annihilation. Player, let me pass. Let me deal with this, and then we can talk this through.",
    "Hah! Oh, child, as if you could stop me.",
    "Player, don't throw away all we have done together on this. Trust me, I do this for the greater good.",
    "I had no choice! I didn't want to, but he was in my way. Don't put yourself in the same position, Player. You have much work ahead of you. I'd hate to be the reason it was cut short.",
    "Player, you've no idea how heavy this burden already is.",
    "You have no idea how much that wounds me, Player. Everything I have done, I have done to help you. My methods may be subtle, but they have always had your best interests at heart.",
    "Yes, of course! I wish I had time to explain it all...but I don't.",
    "Hah. And which one upsets you more, Ariane? I'm surprised you even remember his name.",
    "Don't pretend that means anything to you, Ariane. You forget how well I know you. No, I don't have time for this. I'm sorry, Player, I truly am, but you'll understand in time. You don't understand what you're delaying, and I don't have time to explain it to you!",
    "I don't have time for that. I have important work to do.",
    "His death is regrettable. A tragedy. And I am truly sorry for it. I warned him, but he wouldn't back down. I had no choice! I don't have time to explain this!",
    "That's much appreciated, Player, but I can handle this upstart.",
    "Hah. I'm sure, child, I'm sure. But you're right, I don't want this fight. I don't have the time. Thank you for your support, Player. I wish I could explain things further...but time is short. You don't understand what you're delaying, and I don't have time to explain it to you!",
    "Or so you say...",
    "I don't have time for this. I'm sorry, Player. I have important work to do. And...I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You don't understand what you're delaying, and I don't have time to explain it to you!",
    "Could be kind of fun though.",
    "That was an accident. If he had just left me alone when I told him to... Argh! I don't have time to feel guilty. I'll face my charges when I've finished my work. There's too much at stake for petty recriminations. You don't understand what you're delaying, and I don't have time to explain it to you!",
    "Ah, yes here you are. You know, I did expect you'd find me a little earlier. It was too much to think that you might let me finish my work.",
    "Regrettably, I am doing what must be done, Player. (Continues below)",
    "Haha! What can I say? I love the ambience.",
    "Humour... that's a good sign. Means you're willing to listen to what I have to say. (Continues below)",
    "And here I had hoped for a more amicable outcome. Hear what I have to say, let me explain myself. Then, if you still want to kill me, I won't stop you. (Continues below)",
    "By now I suspect you have followed my journey and visited the strange chambers. So by now you will have learned about the elder gods. Most importantly you will now likely be aware that they are here, on Gielinor, asleep. So you must have realised what will happen when they awaken. Because I've seen what happens... I have seen a world ripped asunder. Reduced to nothing more than ash and cinders. Because when they awoke, they tore the world apart, caring nothing for what lay on the surface. Now only death and desolation remains. This is the fate that awaits Gielinor. When they awaken they will rip everything apart. Falador, Lumbridge, Canifis... All of these will become rubble. Unless someone stops them. And I will stop them!",
    "I have every intention of facing justice for what I have done. But weigh the scales against why I have done it. I am trying to save the world, Ariane! One life, for countless others. A fair trade.",
    "Of course I do! We all do! On each adventure you choose who lives and who dies. Every day we make decisions that sentence some to death and others to salvation, whether we know it or not. You most of all 'World Guardian', whose decisions save or slaughter gods and men alike. At your whim, lives are cut short. At your mercy, they go on. Don't you DARE weigh judgement on me and believe yourself any less guilty of the same crime. (Continues below)",
    "One with a cost that some would be unwilling to pay... but that must be paid. (Continues below).",
    "I would have killed no one, had I the option. Pablo was my friend, but he just wouldn't listen. He refused to let me leave with the research. When I tried to dissuade him, he attacked. I had no choice but to defend myself.",
    "NO! He didn't understand. He was weak! This must be done, or we ALL die! (Continues below)",
    "The research I took...",
    "Stole then. The research was a treatise on the inner mechanics of teleportation. An investigation into crossing the barrier between planes - more importantly, the transfer of matter and energy through them. At first I was able to utilise a very old teleportation spell - one that I knew others would be unable to follow. It took me straight into the Abyss and there I met an ancient creature, with centuries of knowledge. It told me about other worlds that were destroyed by ancient, god-like beings. It wasn't difficult to work out what those beings were. Together we thought of a solution, a way to save this world. The elder gods feed on the Anima Mundi, the natural flow of energy in the world. If we were to take that energy and siphon it away, then the elder gods would never wake up.",
    "An acceptable loss! When compared to the alternative!",
    "A few lives, a few problems... to save EVERYONE from the greater threat! Of all people, Ariane, I thought you would see the necessity in this!",
    "There is no other way. Either we do this, or the whole world dies.",
    "You would put the fate of the world in the hands of a myth? A myth that wants to become the very problem we are trying to stop? No, Player, this is a mortal problem to be solved by mortals, not dead gods.",
    "No world guardian[sic]. I would trust you with anything else, anything other than this. But I will not risk all of Gielinor to glorify a tyrant. I will do what must be done! (Continues below)",
    "Thank you, Player. It makes this horrible task a little less painful, knowing you agree with me. (Continues below)",
    "No! You idiots! There is no other way! I've looked, I've studied. Bah! You may be weak, but I am not. I will do this - you will not stop me! (Continues below)",
    "Looks like it's just you and me then, Ariane. No more World Guardian to do your dirty work. I am finishing this ritual, Ariane. I will siphon the Anima Mundi into the Abyss. The elder gods will sleep and Gielinor will survive. (Continues below)",
    "Haha! Come one, Ariane. You are many things, but you're no murderer."

    "And do they now?",
    "Ariane, wait, stop!",
    "We can talk through this!",
    "I will defend Xenia!",

    "Okay, I'll talk to Kipple.",
    "I have some other questions first.",
    "About Xenia...",

    "Yes.",

    "No.",

    "Anything else?",
    "Okay. Maybe we'll try this again later, Kipple.",
    "How do you know Ariane? Did she create you?",
    "What do you think of Xenia?",
    "Yes, that's what Ariane said, but what do you think of her?",
    "Yes.",
    "No.",
    "No, and don't ask again.",
    "Yes, Kipple.",
    "Thanks, Kipple. Do you know how we can pass it?",
    "I am not TokHaar.",
    "What was Xenia doing?",
    "She came here before me, I think she's the reason I had to repair you.",
    "Her?",
    "Yes, it should be available to all.",
    "The what?",
    "No, only the strong should have it.",
    "Not sure that many races are intelligent.",
    "Who are you?",
    "Who is Wen?",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, I know they are here.",
    "Yes, I'm concerned!",
    "Yes, I'm concerned! The actual creators of the universe are right beneath our feet!",
    "What if they wake up?",
    "Yes. Well, maybe. Possibly. It can't be good really, can it?",
    "Someone bad could find them!",
    "Someone bad could find them. Like a power-hungry god...",
    "I have no idea. Nothing good, I imagine.",
    "Anything could happen.",
    "Anything could happen!",
    "They could wake up and go on a rampage!",
    "We have no idea - that's the point! That's why it's a concern.",
    "They could have a nightmare!",
    "They could have a nightmare.",
    "I imagine they could cause earthquakes and other problems if they were to toss and turn in their sleep.",
    "The Lumbridge Cook might actually cook something!",
    "Fair point. Strike that option off the list.",
    "No, not really.",
    "We'll deal with whatever comes along.",
    "There's no reason to assume they're dangerous.",
    "Something like that.",
    "They're asleep, after all.",
    "They're asleep, after all. No reason to expect that would change any time soon.",
    "I don't care.",
    "No.",
    "No. I had no idea.",
    "What are the elder gods?",
    "So pretty big news, then.",
    "I don't care.",
    "What does that name mean?",
    "How are you damaged?",
    "Her?",
    "Can you tell me about her?",
    "I've no more questions.",
    "What do you mean?",
    "Yes. I fixed you.",
    "Yes.",

    "What was Xenia doing?",
    "Xenia was the person here before.",
    "I am sorry mighty one, I'll explain.",
    "Xenia was the... er... creature that was here before. She would have arrived suddenly and then done something. Disappearing again suddenly afterwards.",
    "They could be useful.",
    "They could be useful. No point just throwing life away.",
    "That's a cold way of looking at it!",
    "That's a cold way of looking at it. We're not talking about a clinical technique, we're talking about living things!",
    "Yes! People have feelings, experiences, families. A rock doesn't mind where it ends up.",
    "As long as it's not me, I don't care!",
    "Then I am dead against this plan!",

    "Who are your creators?",
    "I've got no further questions.",
    "Yes.",
    "No.",
    "Okay, I get that. Let me try again. What do you want to do after we're done with Xenia?",
    "That's what someone else wants you to do, which is almost, but not quite what I asked.",
    "Both of them. I'm proud of you, buddy.",
    "It'll do.",
    "No, we're here to stop what she did. We're not working with her.",
    "Here! Proof!",
    "This footage shows that we believe Xenia to have become dangerously unstable and we're working to stop her.",
    "So here you can see Xenia arriving alone and using a unique teleport spell that we can't replicate.",
    "This proves that we were working in opposition to Xenia's goals!",
    "This proves that Kipple was created to track down Xenia!",
    "This shows that the Golem and I are working together and we're friends!",
    "This evidence shows that we are all working together against Xenia's machinations.",
    "Get me an elder artefact and I'll show you.",
    "You can totally trust me with godlike powers right.",
    "Because power corrupts.",
    "Because power corrupts. No one can have that much power without becoming untrustworthy. Well, almost no one, anyway.",
    "Because the artefacts are too dangerous.",
    "It's not so much that the wielders are dangerous, so much as the artefacts are.",
    "Yes.",
    "No.",
    "No, I'll take care of it myself.",
    "What are you doing Xenia?",
    "So, do you come here often?",
    "Sort of cataclysmic chic - I like it. Could do with some wall hanging or something.",
    "I'm going to kill you Xenia!",
    "Who are you to decide whose life to save?",
    "You don't get to choose who lives and who dies!",
    "She has a point, Ariane.",
    "We've seen enough evidence to know that the elder gods are here, on Gielinor. And if they wake up, they'll do irreparable damage to the entire world. Xenia has made an impossible choice: one we might have made ourselves.",
    "Kill a hundred, just to be sure!",
    "Zaros has a plan! (If completed Fate of the Gods)",
    "He's going to become an elder god, so he can speak on behalf of mortals.",
    "He is not dead! He's alive and his plan could work.",
    "We have to do it.",
    "We have to do it. I know the price is high, but it's worth it to save the world.",

I have already excluded any known magical signatures, so I can focus exclusively on the teleportation signatures that we are looking for. Simply rotate the discs until you discover a complete resonant frequency and I will be able to focus on that energy. I will display a signature that I have discovered but not attuned to, which you can use as a guide to tune me completely to that frequency.",

The research she stole may be dangerous in the hands of others. Maybe the mouthpieces are more sinister than they seem and she is pacifying them. Even if that is the case...

As the Mouthpiece of Jas, I am tied into the Anima Mundi directly and it is that which Xenia endangers. It is the power that flows through the world, the spark that gives it what you call magic, amongst other things.
