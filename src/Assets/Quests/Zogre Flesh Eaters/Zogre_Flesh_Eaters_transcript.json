    "Hello there, what's going on here?",
    "I'm just looking around thanks.",
    "What do you mean sickies?",
    "Sorry, I just don't understand...",
    "Can I help in any way?",
    "Oh, so you want me to find out why the Zogres have appeared and then find a way of burying them?",
    "Right, so you think there's a good chance that I can get ill from this, so I need to get some food and something to drink?",
    "Ok, I'll check things out then and report back.",
    "Hmm, sorry, it sounds a bit too dangerous.",
    "Hmm, is it too late to reconsider?",
    "Yes, I'm really sure!",
    "If that's your idea of a pep talk, I have to say that it leaves a lot to be desired.",
    "What are Zogres?",
    "Sorry, I have to go.",
    "Yes, I want to help you out and find out about the zogres.",
    "Ok, I'll check things out then and report back.",
    "What was it you wanted me to do again?",
    "Oh, so you want me to find out why the Zogres have appeared and then find a way of burying them?",
    "Ok, I'll check things out then and report back.",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "Nope, I haven't figured out why the zogres are here yet.",
    "Hello again.",
    "Yeah, I'm going to help Grish by figuring out what went on here.",
    "Hmm, ok, I'll try to bear that in mind.",
    "What are you selling?",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "But Grish has asked me to look into this place and find out why all the undead ogres are here.",
    "Yes, I'm sure.",
    "Don't worry, I know how to take care of myself.",
    "Urrrgggg.",
    "Urrrgggg.",
    "Aarrrgghhh!",
    "Aarrrgghhh!",
    "Raarrrggggg! Yes!",
    "Raarrrggggg! Yes!",
    "Hello there, I found this tankard in an ogre tomb cavern. It has the emblem of this Inn on it and I wondered if you knew anything about it?",
    "Brentle you say? So you knew him then?",
    "Hmm, I'm sorry to tell you this, but Brentle Vahn is dead - I believe he was murdered.",
    "Hello again. Can you tell me what you know about this tankard again please?",
    "Hello there, I found this black prism, I wondered if you knew anything about it.",
    "But I was told to ring the bell if I wanted some attention.",
    "There's some undead ogre activity over at Jiggig, I've found some clues, I wondered if you'd have a look at them.",
    "I got them from a nearby Ogre tomb, it's recently been infested with zombie ogres and I'm trying to work out what happened there.",
    "Do you have any leads on people that I might talk to regarding this?",
    "There's some undead ogre activity over at 'Jiggig', and the ogres have asked me to look into it. I think I've found a clue and I wonder if you could take a look at it for me?",
    "There's some undead ogre activity over at Jiggig, I've found a clue that you may be able to help with.",
    "Well, I found this...",
    "Not really.",
    "Sure...I mean, I'll try if I remember.",
    "I thought you were here to help?",
    "What did you say I should do?",
    "Where is Sithik?",
    "I want to ask about the Magic Guild.",
    "Sorry, I have to go.",
    "Zavistic Rarve said that I could come and talk to you and ask you a few questions.",
    "Do you know anything about the undead ogres at Jiggig?",
    "Hmm, is that right...",
    "Very well, if you don't know anything about it, you won't mind if I look around then?",
    "What do you do?",
    "The lost arts? What are they?",
    "Hmm, well I guess I must be an ignorant person then, because bringing the dead back to life sounds very unnatural.",
    "Do you mind if I look around?",
    "Well, I'm going to have a look around anyway, if you're not involved in this whole thing, you won't have anything to hide.",
    "I'm sure!",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "Hey there's no need to be rude!",
    "Why do you spend most of your time in bed?",
    "Hmmm, Sithik must really hate monsters then, I wonder if he hates ogres in particular?",
    "Hey, what's this then, can you explain it?!",
    "I found it in a place called Jiggig where some undead ogres happen to be wandering around.",
    "Aha! A necromantic book! What's this doing here then?",
    "I found it in this cupboard! What do you have to say for yourself?",
    "Hmmm, likely story!",
    "Have you ever seen anything like this before?",
    "You should be able to read it, it's been torn from a book on necromancy and you're meant to be a specialist in the subject.",
    "What's this then?",
    "Hmm, that may be true, but I don't universally hate all monsters, whereas I have a sneaking suspicion that you do...and ogres in particular!",
    "What about this then? Guess where I found this?",
    "Aha! But I found this in an old ogre tomb! I suspect it's a clue which will lead me to the suspect.",
    "Oh, so explain this then?",
    "How do I do it...",
    "Here you go, what do you think?",
    "Here you go, what do you think?",
    "Hmm, you've just identified the man who I think sent Brentle Vahn to his death. I'm trying to bring him to justice with the wizards guild grand secretary. Do you think you could sign this portrait to say that he was talking to Brentle Vahn.",
    "Many thanks for your help, it's really very good of you.",
    "Hey, what do you think of this? I'm going to show it to Zavistic and you're going to be in trouble!",
    "I don't think so! This is a signed picture of you, someone recognised you, you're in deep trouble!",
    "You can't buy me Sithik!",
    "Oh...erm...well, that is a lot of money actually...er....",
    "No, I won't take the money, I'm going to bring you to justice!",
    "Ok, I'll shut up for two million!",
    "You're a mean and cruel man Sithik, a mean and cruel man!",
    "I have some items that I'd like you to look at.",
    "I have this necromancy book as evidence that Sithik is involved with the undead ogres at Jiggig.",
    "Please just look at it again...",
    "Yes, but if you look, you can see that there is a half torn page which matches the page I found at Jiggig.",
    "Look, this book proves that Sithik hates all monsters and most likely Ogres with a passion.",
    "Please just look at it again...",
    "This is the tankard I found on the remains of Brentle Vahn!",
    "Please just look at it again...",
    "Look, I made a portrait of Sithik.",
    "This is a portrait of Sithik, signed by the landlord of the Dragon Inn saying that he saw Sithik and Brentle Vahn together.",
    "I want to ask about the Magic Guild.",
    "Sorry, I have to go.",
    "I found this black prism at Jiggig where the undead ogre activity was happening?",
    "No, not yet, what was I supposed to do again?",
    "Well, actually, I've lost it, could I have another one please?",
    "Here, try some of this potion, it'll make you feel better!",
    "It's your own fault, you shouldn't have lied about your involvement with the undead Ogres at Jiggig. The potion will wear off once you've told the truth!",
    "Ok, that's a start...now I want some answers.",
    "How do I remove the effects of the spell from the area? The ogres want to get their ceremonial dance area back and can't do that with undead walking all over it.",
    "You're an evil man and I'm going to make you pay for this...you can stay like that forever as far as I'm concerned.",
    "How do I get rid of the undead ogres?",
    "Yeah, clearly so what should we use?",
    "How do I get rid of the disease?",
    "We'll see about that!",
    "Sorry, I have to go.",
    "I've got some questions for you...and you'd better answer them well or else!",
    "Thanks for your help with all of this.",
    "I found who's responsible for the Zogres being here.",
    "The person responsible is a wizard named 'Sithik Ints' and he's going to be in serious trouble. He told me that the spell which raised the zogres from the ground will last forever. I'm sorry to say, but you'll have to move the site of your ceremonial dancing somewhere else.",
    "Yes, that's right, you'll need to create a new ceremonial dance area.",
    "Oh, so you want me to go back in there and look for something for you?",
    "Nope, not yet.",
    "I have some other questions for you.",
    "I want to talk about the quest",
    "There must be an easier way to kill these zogres! Sithik told me how to make Brutal arrows which means I can kill these zogres from a distance!",
    "I know how to make large arrows...you know, 'big stabbers', to kill the zogres...they're bigger and apparently do a lot of damage, only thing is, the normal ogre bow I need to fire it is quite slow.",
    "Thanks! I think....",
    "There must be a way to cure this disease!",
    "Sorry, I have to go.",
    "No sorry, I don't have them yet.",
    "Yeah, I have them here!",
    "Thanks, that's very nice of you!",
    "How's everything going now?",
    "How\u2019s everything going now?",
    "What are you selling?",
    "Hey, here you go! I brought you some of the potion which should cure the disease. You said that you would buy some from me.",
    "I'll sell it to you for 2000 coins!",
    "I think I\u2019m going to take it to Yanni for an even greater reward.",
    "Yes, I'll sell it for 5000 coins.",
    "No, I think I'll hold on it a while longer yet."

    "Hmmm, now this is interesting! Where did you get these from?",
    "This is very troubling Player, very troubling indeed. While it's permitted for learned members of our order to research the 'dark arts', it's absolutely forbidden to make use of such magic.",
    "Well a wizard by the name of 'Sithik Ints' was doing some research in this area. He may know something about it. He's lodged at that guest house to the North, though he's ill and isn't able to leave his room.",
    "Why not go and talk to him, poke around a bit and see if anything comes up. Let me know how you get on. However, I doubt that 'Sithik' had anything to do with it.",
    "There's a severe penalty for using the 'dark arts'. If you find any evidence to the contrary, please bring it to me.",
    "Hmm, that black prism seems to have some magical protection. Once you've finished with this item, bring it back to me would you. I may have a reward for you.",
    "Hmmm, well this is an uncommon spell component. On it's own it's useless, but with certain necromantic spells it can be very powerful. Did you find anything else there?",
    "Hmm, this is a half torn spell page, it requires another spell component to be effective. Did you find anything else there?",
    "Hmmm, no, that's not really associated with this to be honest. Did you find anything else there?",
    "I don't know what to say then, there isn't enough to go on with the clues you've shown me so far. I'd suggest going back to search a bit more, but you may just be wasting your time? Hmm, but this prism does seem to have some magical protection. Once you've finished with this item, bring it back to me would you? I may have a reward for you!",
    "What are you doing bothering me? Don't you think some of us have work to do?",
    "Well... I am, I suppose, anyway... we're very busy here, hurry up, what do you want?",
    "What are you doing...Oh, it's you...sorry...didn't realise...what can I do for you?",
    "What are you doing...Oh, it's you...sorry...didn't realise...what can I do for you?",
    "You should go and have a chat with Sithik Ints, he's in that house just to the north. He's a lodger and has a room upstairs. Just tell him that I sent you to see him. He should be fine once you've mentioned my name.",
    "He's in that house just to the north, less than a few seconds walk away. He's a lodger and has a room upstairs...he's not very well though.",
    "Sure, go ahead, ask away.",
    "What are you doing...Oh, it's you...sorry...didn't realise...what can I do for you?",
    "Yeah, you've shown me this before...if this is all the evidence you have?",
    "Ok, let me look then.",
    "Ok, so he's researching necromancy...it doesn't mean anything in itself.",
    "Hmm, yes, but someone could have stolen that from him and then gone and cast it without his permission or to try and deliberately implicate him.",
    "Yeah, you've shown me this before...if this is all the evidence you have?",
    "Ok, let me look then.",
    "So what, hating monsters isn't a crime in itself...although I suppose that it does give a motive if Sithik was involved. On its own, it's not enough evidence though.",
    "Yeah, you've shown me this before...if this is all the evidence you have?",
    "Ok, let me look then.",
    "That doesn't mean anything in itself, you could have gotten that from anywhere. Even from the Dragon Inn tavern! There isn't anything to link Brentle Vahn with Sithik Ints.",
    "Hmm, great...but I already know what he looks like!",
    "Hmmm, well that is interesting. And I'm starting to think that Sithik may be involved. Here, take this potion and give some to Sithik. It'll bring on a change which should solicit some answers - tell him the effects won't revert until he's told the truth.",
    "Sure, go ahead, ask away.",
    "Yes, you've already showed me that, bring it to me when you've resolved the problems at Jiggig and I'll see what I can do.",
    "What are you doing...Oh, it's you...sorry...didn't realise...what can I do for you? Have you used that potion yet?",
    "Try to use the potion on Sithik somehow, he should undergo an interesting transformation, though you'll probably want to leave the house in case there are any side effects. Then go back and question Sithik and tell him the effects won't wear off until he tells the truth. In fact, that's not exactly true, but I'm sure it'll be an extra incentive to get him to be honest.",
    "Sure, but don't lose it this time.",
    "What are you doing...Oh, it's you...sorry...didn't realise...what can I do for you?",
    "Don't you worry about Sithik, he's not likely to be moving from his bed for a long time.",
    "When he eventually does get better, he's going to be sent before a disciplinary tribunal, then we'll sort out what's what.",
    "Ooohh, no thanks required. It's I who should be thanking you my friend...your investigative mind has shown how vigilant we really should be for this type of evil use of the magical arts.",
    "Ah yes, I remember saying something about a reward didn\u2019t I? Well, I can offer you 2000 coins for it as it stands, but I know that Yanni Salika in Shilo Village would offer you more than twice as much.",

    "Well, yes, yes it is. If I knew something, I'd tell you. Anyways, dead ogres you say? How strange? That must be a strange sight?",
    "I'm a scholarly student of the magical arts. When I was younger I used to be an adventurer, probably just like yourself. But I lost interest in the constant fighting, looting and gaining abilities. Instead I decided to focus my attention and time to study the purer form of the lost arts.",
    "Ignorant people call them the 'dark arts'. I'm talking about Necromancy, the power to bring the dead back to life - the power of the gods! Surely the most awesome power known to man.",
    "Well,err....well, actually yes I do mind...it's my place and I don't want strangers going through my things.",

    "Oh, nothing to do with me then, never seen it in my life before!",
    "Oh..I'm not quite sure actually...where did you find that then?",
    "Oh yes, that's right...I remember now. It's for my research, there's nothing really dangerous about it, unless it falls into the wrong hands. I'm sure it's pretty safe with me.",
    "It's probably a piece of rubbish someone threw away...what does it say, I can't read it?",
    "Oh, no..., not really a specialist, just a hobby of mine really. Hardly know anything about it, but it does seem interesting...",
    "What do you mean? It's a book by the respected HAM leader Johanhus Ulsbrecht, that man speaks for a lot of people who are unhappy with the current state of affairs. Can you honestly tell me that you've not had to fight for your life against the odd monster or two?",
    "Hmm, that's an interesting theory, care to back it up with any facts?",
    "You probably found it at the local brewhouse! It doesn't take a genius to figure that one out.",
    "Hmmm, well that eliminates all the local people who don't actually drink at the 'Dragon Inn'. When do you think you'll start questioning the remaining population of Yanille?",
    "It's my hobby...I'm interested in portraiture, but all art in general. It's fun, you should try it.",
    "Well...you could start by reading the book!",
    "Oh lovely! You're making my portrait! Let me see it afterwards!",
    "Hmmm, well it's an interesting interpretation, but not really classic realist representation is it? It's not my favourite, but I like the 'truth' of the work...well done.",
    "Hmmm, well it's not the most flattering of portraits, but I like the 'honesty' of the work...well done.",
    "Hmmm, well, I've got quite a common looking face, I'm often mistaken for other wizards, you know, when I'm wearing my wizard's hat, robes and staff. There's a lot of us around here you know.",
    "Ok, I'll pay you to keep this secret - how much do you want for the picture?",
    "Ok, let's say two million...two million to keep quiet and give me the picture.",
    "Yes, and you deserve it, you're very clever! Now, take the money...",
    "Oh well, suit yourself! I wasn't going to give you the money anyway! No one will believe some crazy adventurer and an Inn keep.",
    "Ha! Ha! You believed me! I'm not going to give you all my money! No one will believe a crazy adventurer and a local Inn keep!",
    "Err, yuck....no way am I taking any potions or medication off you...I don't trust you!",
    "Arghhhh..what's happened to me...you beast!",
    "Ok, ok, I admit it, I got Brentle Vahn to cast the spell to put an end to those awful Ogres...they're just disgusting creatures...",
