Finish the dialogue and cutscene then continue north to interrogate the merchant.----
Hunt for 3 memories (having sound turned on helps a lot here).----
Move your mouse around until the orange circle rapidly beats on one spot and click. There are three speeds--you want to click at the fastest, highest-pitched ping (there are three settings). Repeat until all three memories are recovered.---
If only half the memory is recovered, you did not do this step correctly and as a result an unabridged tome will not be awarded----
A pinging sound will play if game sounds are turned on: a slow hum (level 1), a moderately fast ping (level 2, indicating you are close to the correct position), and a fast, high-frequency ping that plays ~2 times a second. This is the correct location for full memory retrieval.---
The correct location DOES NOT ALWAYS correspond to the centre of a memory you can see. It can also be an empty space.`
