Talk to Seegud north-east of the bank.`
To clear the bugs, eucalyptus logs and different plant types are needed.`
Plant and rock combinations are different for every player, using a reference chart like below will help with the process.`
Collect 16 eucalyptus logs and 7 each of the five type of herbs from outside of Oo'glog.`
Head north-west of Seegud to the saltwater spring.`
Examine the stones between the spring and the fire pit.`
Open the quest log to find what log/plant goes with the examination message.`
Place eucalyptus logs and the correct combination of plants in the fire pit and light them. The insects won't disperse.`
Talk to Seegud (Chat 2•1).`
Head back to the spring and talk to Snarrk.`
Disperse the insects from each of the pools. Each of the five pools will have a fire pit and a pile of stones beside it, with all pools sharing one common stone. This stone represents eucalyptus logs, which must be added to every fire. Examine the piles of stones for a detailed description of each stone.`
Start with the thermal bath, north-east of Seegud. This fire pit requires eucalyptus logs and one of the five plants in order to disperse the insects. By trial and error, determine which plant is needed for this pool and memorise the corresponding stone. If done correctly, the swarm of insects above the pool will vanish completely.`
Next, move to the mud bath to the east -- this fire pit requires eucalyptus logs and two plants. The primary plant of this pool is the same as the plant used at the thermal bath. Figure out the secondary plant by using any of the other four unused plants, until the correct combination is discovered.`
Move to the salt-water spring west of the thermal bath -- this fire pit requires eucalyptus logs and two plants. Be sure to use the secondary plant from the mud bath as the primary plant for this pool. Find the secondary plant by using the three remaining herbs until the correct one is found.`
Now head to the sulphur spring -- this fire pit requires eucalyptus logs and two plants. Use the secondary plant for the salt-water spring as the primary plant for this spring. One of the two remaining herbs will be the secondary plant, so try them both.`
Lastly, head to the Bandos pool -- this fire pit requires eucalyptus logs and three plants. Use the secondary plant from the mud bath, the secondary plant from the sulphur pool and the unused herb.`
After all of the bugs are taken care of, talk to Seegud.`
