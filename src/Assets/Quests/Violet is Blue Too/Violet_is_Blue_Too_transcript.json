    "To be completely honest, Player. Not really. Ever since we opened the P.P.S, delivering letters has become an absolute nightmare.",
    "The Portal Postal Services of course! Concept is simple really, each world has a postal service employee such as myself. They gather the letters and then pop them through a designated portal. But, there seems to be a problem with letters coming from the Land of Snow.",
    "There are no letters coming through! Not a single one. Usually at this time of year I'd be up to my eye-sockets in the things with it being so close to Christmas.",
    "If you could just pop into the Land of Snow through that portal there and see if you can figure out why no letters have come through.",
    "A shame. Well, you know where to find me if you're willing to help out.",
    "So what did you find?",
    "Well that's no good.",

    "Did you say Player? That's me!",
    "It's Violet!",
    "You know? Violet, little girl about your height and likes to roar at anything that moves?",
    "Well, the letters are from her! I should pop in. See how she is.",
    "You hardly helped me out, you just gave me my letters.",
    "I can do that.",
    "Now, if I remember correctly, Violet's house is just up that hill.",

    "Oh wow. You're quite the artist now, Violet!",
    "Why can't you have a real tree?",
    "I'm sure he knows you've been a good girl and I'm even more sure you're going to be on his nice list! I wonder if we can find you a small Christmas tree.",
    "I don't see a problem with cutting any old fir tree down. You've got plenty of trees just across the yard.",
    "I don't think chopping down a tree should take that long. That leaves plenty of time for play.",
    "And where might that be?",
    "A map to an enchanted Christmas tree farm! What more could you want from an adventure.",
    "What's your idea?",
    "Clues?",
    "Kind of like a clue scroll?",
    "A scroll with a clue on it.",
    "Nevermind! What's my first clue?",
    "Nothing in here except some dried up vegetables.",

    "Who?",
    "Something like that. All a good bit of fun.",
    "You're never too old for a good old fashioned treasure hunt!",

    "Okay, I'm shutting them.",
    "Okay.",
    "Where did these come from?",
    "What the...",
    "Actual talking snowmen! But how?!",
    "[sic]",
    "Snow imps!",

    "Do either of you two know anything about the missing snow imp?",
    "His name is [Imp name].",
    "Oh that's a relief.",
    "What were you playing?",
    "You mean to tell me that [Imp name] may or may not still be playing a two week long game of hide and don't peek?",
    "We should really go find him.",
    "Where were you playing with him?",
    "What are snow imps doing here?",
    "We should ask them about the missing snow imp, I did say I'd look out for him.",
    "We're currently looking for a map to an enchanted Christmas tree farm!",
    "The snow imps said they were playing at this abandoned farm here. Lets have a quick look around to see if we can find him.",
    "I wonder if that's because you're wearing a bucket on your head.",
    "Right. Well, in that case. You protect me whilst I have a look around for [Imp name].",
    "No snow imp hiding here.",
    "I can hear something moving inside this chest! Here goes nothing. Violet, you might want to shut your eyes.",
    "[Snow imp]?",
    "Are you alright?",
    "I see where this is going. Classic.",
    "I was under the impression that imps could teleport.",
    "What's the matter?",
    "Why would you, a snow imp, be decorating for a town of Yeti?",
    "I'm sorry but, I don't see where this is going.",
    "Ummmm I don't know if tha-",
    "That sounds like it came from the town? I suppose one quick peek can't hurt. It doesn't seem too far from here anyway. Should probably also investigate the source of that bang.",
    "Well, I guess you won your game of hide and don't peek.",
    "Language, [Snow imp]! We've got a impressionable child with us!",
    "We'd better go see what they're shouting about.",
    "Qui-",
    "Ssshhh-",
    "Can't forget that extra half.",
    "Wooooo- Wait, what? We are?",
    "How about you sit down for a while. You've gone through quite the traumatic experience. I can't imagine getting trapped in a box has done you any favours.",
    "Okay, Violet. Let's pick an assistant to help out.",
    "You're right, let's talk to the assistants and see what can be done about that.",
    "Well, Violet. You seem to have rallied the town to band together to fix up this mess. Let's see what we can do to help.",
    "Nicked what?",
    "Why did you have the list in the first place? Isn't that list strictly for Santa's eyes only?",
    "Hey there, do you know anything about Santa's missing list?",
    "We didn't accuse you of anything. We're just trying to find that list. No list means no presents.",
    "We're looking for Santa's list! We were told you might have it.",
    "Okay, let me guess. You passed it along to someone else.",
    "What do you mean 'after you were done with it'?",
    "We spoke to Peter. He told us you've got Santa's list so drop the act and give us the list.",
    "Finishing touches? What are these kids up to?",
    "Oh now I get it. Impish mishcheif corrupting the innocent Yeti children.",
    "What did you all want with the list.",
    "Why am I not suprised.",
    "Violet? What are you doing?",
    "What did you do to that list?",
    "You're a thoughtful one, Violet, but you're as cheeky as a snow imp! Your secret is safe with me.",
    "What seems to be the matter?",
    "...",
    "Yeah...",
    "It's a good thing we're here to help out.",
    "Dare I ask?",
    "I'm guessing that very special tree happens to be the one on fire?",
    "What do you think, Violet? Reckon we can convince Taylor to give Brad another chance and get another tree.",
    "Not yet you little rascal! Let's go and find this farm.",
    "Fireworks aren't exactly your most traditional tree decorations.",
    "Who would have thought!",
    "We've not spoken to Taylor yet.",
    "You must be Taylor? We're wondering if you could help us out with a new Christmas tree?",
    "I like to think it was just a little mistake.",
    "Well, they don't just pop into existance. So I'm guessing quite a while.",
    "Violet! Don't just copy words you don't know the meaning of! Your parents will think I'm teaching you naughty words!",
    "It's a little bit... Wonky? Don't you think? I doubt by the time we haul it over to the town it would have any leaves left.",
    "See, Violet. How about one of these nice ones next to it.",
    "It means this tree is going to go live on another farm.",
    "Hmmm. I guess with a bit of love, care and some decorations it'll look quite special.",
    "Good thinking, Violet.",
    "Cor blimey! That is one ugly tree!",
    "Oh.",
    "Nope! Taylor was more than happy to help us out and you did say Violet could choose whatever tree she wanted!",
    "We should help out the assistants before we try and decorate the tree.",
    "Cor blimey! That is one ugly tree!",
    "How can we decorate if someone set all the decorations on fire.",
    "I hope they'll be willing as they didn't seem too happy when we arrived.",
    "Hello?",
    "Violet, perhaps we should try a diff-",

    "We've already got decorations from this house.",
    "We've already got decorations from this house.",
    "That should be enough.",
    "Jhee, it's getting quite late an-",
    "There she goes again. Signing me up for the hard work.",
    "That looks like all the assistants helped out. Let's go tell [Snow imp]!",
    "We should let [Snow imp] know that we've helped out all his assistants.",
    "I suppose us sorting that out might make you finally happy?",
    "Hey buddy, we're doing you a real solid here. The least you could do is be a little more enthusiatic. I didn't hear any complaining from your assistants. Infact, they were more than willing to let Violet and I help out.",
    "We'll have to look around for a ladde-",
    "Okay, how do you plan on reaching all the way up there?",
    "Of course! Snow impli- Wait what? Snow implings?",
    "How on earth did you think of that.",
    "Of course you did. It sounds like a great plan. Let's see if we can find some snow implings that are willing to help us out.",
    "What the-",
    "Why would I grab you?",
    "I'm not here to catch you.",
    "Uhhh I don't think s-",
    "No that's not wha-",

    "Beautiful...",

    "Look! Here comes everybody.",
    "We did quite a good job, eh Violet?...",
    "Turned out alright in the end.",
    "I should get her home now. Glad we could help out, [Snow imp].",

    "How strange...",
    "It doesn't look the same as when I last left it.",
