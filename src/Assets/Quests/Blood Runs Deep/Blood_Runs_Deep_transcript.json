  "Baba Yaga": [
    "I don't think you'll get much talk out of him.",
    "I wish I knew. He washed up on the shore as though he'd fallen from a ship, but we never saw it. I was hoping that you'd be able to help me.",
    "Wonderful! Now where to start? He looks surprisingly healthy, considering. He still hasn't come around, though. I'm worried that he may have some illness of the mind.",
    "There is one thing we could try.",
    "Let us travel into his dream world and see if we can't find the root of the problem!",
    "Good! Remember, anything can happen in a dream world. I'm sure you remember all the fighting last time you went, so, if I were you, I'd come ready for war. I'll sort out the potions we need. Meet me back here when you're ready and we'll go to the brazier together.",
    "That is a shame. Be sure to come back when you can.",
    "Have you decided to help us?",
    "Are you ready? Don't forget that the consequences of anything that happens to you in a dream world may be only too real.",
    "Excellent!",
    "Hurry, he may be in danger.",
    "What is this place? It looks like the home of our sick sea-captain.",
    "Really? None at all? Let's think about it: we've got pieces of dream world arranged like the floors of a tower, with a big flashing glow at the top.",
    "Only literally. There are other platforms above and below. A tower here doesn't need walls, only for the dreamer to expect it to stand.",
    "I think so. Don't forget the flashing light.",
    "I doubt it. It's very spacious for a ship, and even in a dream world you expect it to move a little. It's almost like a tower, and don't forget the big pulsing glow up above.",
    "Do you know what happened to him?",
    "I think that's what he's writing now.",
    "Well, yes, but what does that tell you?",
    "Have you seen what he's writing?",
    "Having come into his dream world to help him with his real-world catatonia, I would be quite disappointed if he weren't.",
    "Indeed.",
    "Come on, I don't think we're helping much here. Let's search the room and be moving on.",
    "Hurry up. I've been in the dream worlds of some pretty strange people, and the atmosphere here is...unusual.",
    "Are you sure we've searched the room thoroughly? We might not be able to get back once we leave.",
    "That's probably all we're going to find here. I wonder where the stairs lead.",
    "Not that way, we need to press on.",
    "Wait, we can probably learn something here.",
    "Let's see if we can hear anything.",
    "Her plan sounds quite thorough.",
    "That doesn't sound good at all. We need to find a lectern and get out of here. Let's check out that tunnel over there.",
    "Come on, let's get out of here!",
    "Look, he is on his own at last! Perhaps this one can see us.",
    "We're here to help you get away from here. Hurry, [Fremennik Name], try the lectern.",
    "Finally, a way out. Except... It's not working!",
    "I don't know, I'll have to study it.",
    "Oh, you really are sick, aren't you? She's not sending them, not in here. You are the only one making the danger in here. [Fremennik Name], I need you to hold them off. Don't worry about me, just keep their attention and keep yourself alive until the lectern is ready. I'll help where I can.",
    "I have # sharks left",
    "Did it! That was close!",
    "You left the dream world without a lectern, and made me come back as well! In the dreams of a fragile mind we cause more harm than good if we don't follow the rules.",
    "Now, are you ready to go back?",
    "Good.",
    "I don't see any change, yet.",
    "Oh my, the Oneiromancer!",
    "... ... ...",
    "Already? But that's terrible!",
    "If you're ready now, I know a trick to get you there quickly.",
    "Don't be too long.",
    "Could I just see your seal of passage for a moment, please?",
    "What are you doing here, Fremennik?",
    "Ready to join the battle for Relleka?",
    "[Fremennik Name], Chieftain Brundt: I'd like to talk about the prophecy tablets we've been finding.",
    "Except that, this time, we've almost got the whole set.",
    "Chieftain, I'm sorry about that, but it was a long time ago. We've got more pressing concerns now.",
    "[Fremennik Name], did you bring all the ones you found so far?",
    "Not to worry. I had a look at the one you found in the dream world lighthouse. It said: 'When the tide is strongest, Good Intent will be needed once more.'",
    "I have another tablet. We found it near where Silas had washed up. It reads: 'The lost Mother is dead, her Daughter risen in her place.' Then there's the one Chieftain Brundt and his friends recovered all those years ago, which said: 'And [his/her] name will be [Fremennik Name].' For a long time I was too short-sighted to understand the last one, but now it sounds like you're the one fated to sort this out.",
    "Yeah, that looks right! And 'And [his/her] name will be [Fremennik Name].' is probably last.",
    "I'm not so sure about that.",
    "Well, I'd guess that first comes this one: 'All-consuming Darkness will rise from the sea, unleashed by Good Intent.' 'The lost Mother is dead, her Daughter risen in her place.' sets the scene a little more, so that's probably next. 'And [his/her] name will be [Fremennik Name].' sounds like it should be last. That leaves us with 'When the tide is strongest, Good Intent will be needed once more.' in between.",
    "Perhaps.",
    "Not quite. The second tablet worries me. [Fremennik Name], have you seen a dagannoth mother before?",
    "I thought so. Under the lighthouse, yes?",
    "I think [Fremennik Name] is the 'Good Intent that unleashed the Darkness'.",
    "[He/she] had no choice, Brundt. Let's not dwell on it. I think the lesson that we need to learn is that we mustn't kill the mother; she needs to be confined somehow, so that the colony can't replace her.",
    "Come on, let's keep going.",
    "We should have someone take watch here in case the dagannoths sneak up behind us.",
    "Wait! What's that noise behind us?",
    "The Dagannoth Kings? I have heard of them. [Fremennik Name], you go ahead and deal with the mother. The rest of us will help Koschei.",
    "We will be fine. I promise.",
    "Between us you have a master swordsman, an archer and a lunar mage. Not to mention Prince Brand to keep up the morale. We will be fine, I promise.",
    "Oh, [Fremennik Name], thank goodness you're alive. We barely made it through, those of us who made it at all.",
    "Let's get out of here.",
    "Oh, [Fremennik Name], thank goodness you're alive. I'm sorry for your loss.",
    "I don't know what else I can say, [Fremennik Name]. I did everything I could, but it wasn't enough.",
    "That's not true! We needed both of them! There was no way Koschei and I would have managed without them.",
    "I know, and that was a mistake. I made a promise I couldn't keep and for that I'm sorry. Your wife/husband died a heroine/hero and saved us all.",
    "Listen to yourself, [Fremennik Name], you dishonour her/his memory by ignoring what she/he achieved",
    "I don't have to put up with this.",
    "I did, [Fremennik Name]. I did.",
    "They didn't die in vain. We would have lost without them, then you would have had the dagannoth kings at your back while you fought the mother.",
    "So, the mother is defeated? I think we have to consider that a good result, on balance. Silas was making a strong recovery and seemed really eager to go, so we let him leave.",
    "Exactly. I'm not going to look after someone against their will. He will be safe, don't worry."
  ],
  "Player": [
    "Who is he?",
    "Yes, I think I can manage that.",
    "Is there anything we can do?",
    "Sounds like a lost cause.",
    "Yes?",
    "I think I can guess what's coming.",
    "An excellent idea!",
    "If we must.",
    "I'm sorry, I'm far too busy.",
    "I am ready.",
    "Not yet.",
    "I've no idea.",
    "Let me guess: is it some kind of floating platform with no walls?",
    "So it's a tower.",
    "It's a big cabin on a mighty ship.",
    "I think I've got it. I remember this place \u2013 at least, the real one. It's a lighthouse. This is his home, but he's no sea-captain; he's the lighthouse keeper. Or at least he was.",
    "His name is Silas. He went missing and I helped his nephew look for him, but we never found him. It seems that he became obsessed with the creatures in the basement of the lighthouse. His journal from the time is quite a disturbing read.",
    "It's a tower with a flashing light?",
    "He's crazy.",
    "Poor man.",
    "She didn't count on us finding out.",
    "I'll stop her!",
    "I'm a friend of your nephew.",
    "I'm a powerful hero, come to save you.",
    "None of your business.",
    "What do you mean, 'not working'?",
    "Can you make it work?",
    "I'm ready.",
    "What is?",
    "Will you two please stop that?",
    "I need to go to the bank first.",
    "I'm ready. What's your trick?",
    "Now what?",
    "What? But I have a seal of pass... Oh, I get it. I see what you did there.",
    "What is the matter, Your Majesty?",
    "I'll set out right away.",
    "I'd love to help, but Rellekka needs me.",
    "I know: King Vargas is missing. The dagannoths of Waterbirth Island have him.",
    "You haven't lost him.",
    "You'll never lose me, Astrid.",
    "Let's just see how it goes.",
    "You haven't lost your father.",
    "You'll never lose me, Brand.",
    "Let's just see how it goes.",
    "Chieftain Brundt, could I have another seal of passage, please? Baba Yaga kept mine when I came back to help.",
    "I will stay here for the moment.",
    "I'll go with you.",
    "Could we go to the bank on Etceteria, please?",
    "What kind of voices?",
    "Sounds that way to me.",
    "Could it be an old man echoing from underground?",
    "Have you seen anything else that was strange?",
    "We aren't out yet.",
    "You probably still will be.",
    "Come on, this isn't the King Vargas I'm used to.",
    "Pull yourself together, Your Majesty.",
    "No, I can imagine.",
    "That's more like it. Good to have you back, Your Majesty.",
    "Yes, it is. I do heroic things all the time, but you don't see me complaining.",
    "I'll have to take the passage to the lighthouse.",
    "Let's go that way then.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Certainly, I've got some here.",
    "I will do.",
    "I have, but I might need it later.",
    "I'll see what I can do",
    "I'll stay close to you. Come on.",
    "Phew, barely made it out of there. Now I suppose I need to find King Vargas again.",
    "Sure, let's go.",
    "Is everything all right up there? I knew I should have gone first.",
    "Well, as quickly as you can, please.",
    "You aren't gravely wounded, you sop!",
    "Don't touch anything! Just get up the ladder and out of the way!",
    "Hurry up! You're going to get us both killed!",
    "Pardon?",
    "Who did?",
    "Where am I?",
    "Am I...dead?",
    "I'm not supposed to be here?",
    "Can you at least explain where I am?",
    "I know what this place is.",
    "This is some great afterlife for warriors to sit and drink.",
    "And you say I'm not allowed in?",
    "I'd best be getting back, then.",
    "Where is 'here'?",
    "How do I get back then?",
    "I bet they're all drinking.",
    "So now what?",
    "Can you send me back?",
    "How do I get back?",
    "...",
    "Hey, that's not fair!",
    "She took the news well. Last time I spoke to her she was going to move to Neitiznot to be with her brother.",
    "The dagannoths are mounting a massive attack on nearby settlements.",
    "It's nothing I can't handle.",
    "Well, you wouldn't normally find me here.",
    "Oh, you know, bits and pieces...",
    "...",
    "I'm not falling for that again.",
    "Just passing through.",
    "I could ask you the same question.",
    "You realise they're waiting for a huge battle?",
    "I don't recall that working out so well last time.",
    "Just provided you realise the danger.",
    "I'd rather carry on with my quest, thanks.",
    "Yes, please.",
    "Not yet, thank you.",
    "What happened?",
    "Where am I?",
    "I'm always up for a challenge",
    "I don't like the sound of that.",
    "I'd be honoured, Your Majesties!",
    "I suppose I could do that.",
    "I don't really know what to do.",
    "(Chosen response)",
    "...we are gathered here today...",
    "(Chosen response)",
    "...to join this man and this woman in matrimony.",
    "...to bring together the great kingdoms of Miscellania and Etceteria, by joining their rulers in matrimony.",
    "...to bring war to the daggermouths and crush them beneath our boots!",
    "Well, we didn't really come here for the wedding. With a bit more planning you could have had it somewhere much nicer.",
    "Yes, certainly.",
    "I suppose so.",
    "Do you, King Vargas, take Queen Sigrid as your lawful wife?",
    "(Chosen response)",
    "(Chosen response)",
    "Do you, Queen Sigrid...",
    "...take King Vargas as your lawful husband?",
    "(Chosen response)",
    "(Chosen response)",
    "Same question.",
    "Obviously. Well, do you?",
    "Then, by the power vested in me as Regent of Miscellania and Etceteria, I pronounce you husband and wife.",
    "That's a(n) [wonderful/excellent] idea!",
    "There is nobody to perform the ceremony.",
    "Very well.",
    "Let's discuss it later.",
    "Yeah, about the whole marriage thing...",
    "I, [Fremennik Name]...",
    "...take thee, [Astrid/Brand]...",
    "...to be my [wife/husband] until death.",
    "...take thee, [Gudurn/(Transcript missing. edit)]...",
    "Astrid, I mean Astrid.",
    "I do.",
    "Well, actually...",
    "Nothing, sorry, carry on.",
    "I don't think this is such a good idea.",
    "Agreed, let's get a move on.",
    "Actually, could you drop me off at the bank on Etceteria?",
    "I'd like to stay here a while longer.",
    "Let's go now.",
    "Later, perhaps.",
    "(Say nothing)",
    "Got there in the end.",
    "Yes, I have two.  The one from the lighthouse says: 'When the tide is strongest, Good Intent will be needed once more.' King Vargas gave me one saying 'All-consuming Darkness will rise from the sea, unleashed by Good Intent.' I wonder what that is supposed to mean.",
    "I've seen two, if you don't count the one Chieftain Brundt and the others fought a yeti for. I didn't bring them, though.",
    "(Work out the order)",
    "What do you think?",
    "Yes, I have \u2013 I killed her.",
    "(Lie) No, I haven't.",
    "I don't remember.",
    "No, of course not!",
    "Yes, I suppose it is.",
    "That's not fair!",
    "(Any Response)",
    "I know where her lair is; King Vargas told me.",
    "I'm ready.",
    "I'll speak to you again when I'm ready.",
    "Yes, let's go now.",
    "Later, perhaps.",
    "That sounds reasonable.",
    "I suppose so.",
    "Good luck.",
    "I need you with me.",
    "You'll be killed!",
    "What, no speech?",
    "I thought there might be a bit more. You know, from someone with such flowery speech. I suppose that's the Silas influence. Did you ever read his diary?",
    "Of course not.",
    "Maybe just a little.",
    "No, I wasn't complaining.",
    "Whatever.",
    "So, if I weaken the pillar and prop it up with wood as I go, I can then set fire to the wood and run.",
    "Stupid thing. Just a bit more.",
    "Aaghhh!!!",
    "Excellent!",
    "Actually, I was hoping you'd say that.",
    "I'll live.",
    "I seem to have died again.",
    "Yes, I am.",
    "Not yet.",
    "Poor [Brand/Astrid]. She will be missed.",
    "Astrid? Astrid, dear? No!",
    "Wait until I find those kings...",
    "Poor Astrid. She will be missed.",
    "What happened here?",
    "You're 'sorry'? Is that it? My [wife/husband] is dead and you're 'sorry'?",
    "You're right, I'm sorry.",
    "You promised to keep her safe!",
    "She/He was no use to you, but you took her/him anyway and assured me she/he would be fine!",
    "You promised...",
    "You're right, I'm sorry",
    "What good is that?",
    "If it wasn't for you she'd/he'd be safe on Miscellania now, rather than lying lifeless in this foul cave.",
    "You're right, I'm sorry",
    "How dare you?",
    "Don't lecture me about honouring my wife, you arrogant witch!",
    "I'm sure you did everything you could.",
    "Thank you. I'll make sure King Vargas hears that.",
    "They didn't make it.",
    "Dead, all of them.",
    "He's right. We've won!",
    "The war is won, but the price was heavy.",
    "Don't worry, I will.",
    "Well, I suppose if he was healthy enough...",
    "You just let him go?",
    "It's good to have King Vargas back.",
    "I think I may have found your uncle.",
    "Well, he was being looked after by the mages in Lunar Isle but, when he got better, he wanted to leave, so they had to let him go.",
    "At least we know he's alive and well. I'm sure he'll show up sooner or later.",
    "Have you heard any news of the Fremennik war against the daggermouths?",
    "I'm surprised to see you still here.",
    "I have good news. I've been to the afterlife - long story - and Nial was there, safe and sound.",
    "Greetings, Hamal. I have good news. I have been to the afterlife and can tell you that your daughter made it there safe and sound.",
    "I have good news. I have been to the afterlife and Asleif is there, happy and peaceful."

If you've got everything you need, I suggest you use your Fremennik sea boots and enchanted lyre to go straight to their doorstep, getting the jump on the daggermouths! When you get there, keep an eye out for Bardur. He's always there slaying daggermouths: perhaps he'll have seen something. If you'd rather, you can come back to Rellekka with me to prepare.",

    "Ah, [Fremennik Name], good to see you lively again.",

    "But, as it is, we are told nothing about the present or the future?",
    "I tire of all this talk! What are you saying, witch?",
    "What? [Fremennik Name], this is your doing?",
    "Very well, [Fremennik Name]. When we arrive at Waterbirth, you should take a small group there and deal with her. I will lead everyone else in a frontal assault to cause them casualties and buy you some time. We'll land as soon as we're all ready.",
    "I was hoping you'd say that.",
    "How do you do that? You just jump overboard? I've come back for you, but we really must get back to the fleet.",
