How to kill Vanstrom:`
Only blisterwood weaponry can deal damage.`
If you're attacking at a distance use magic protection prayers; otherwise, Deflect/Protect from Melee.`
If he shouts "Stare into the darkness!" run to the edge of the arena and rotate your camera away from him. Maximum 4000 damage.`
If he shouts "Let the blood consume you!" run away from the blood splodge on the floor. Maximum 6000 damage.`
If he shouts "Come, fiends, and aid your master!" kill the two easy minions that he spawns.`
If he throws blood bombs towards you, keep running around the room to avoid them. Maximum 4000 damage per bomb.`
Once he is very low health he turns into a cloud. Keep using holy water near him until he loses all health. Unequip your ring of life if you're wearing one.`
If you are saved by a ring of life after a group of bloodveld guardians spawn, heal up and return without a ring of life. You will be damaged, but in a safe way. You will not have to redo the fight.`
Use Deflect/Protect from Magic for this last part as Vanstom can do rapid magic damage to you whilst he is dying.`
