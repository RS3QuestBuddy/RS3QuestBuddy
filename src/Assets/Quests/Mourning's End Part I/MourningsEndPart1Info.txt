Skip this section if you have an extra barrel of naphtha from Regicide.`
Return to Isafdar, head to the Poison Waste a few steps south of the Tirannwn lodestone.`
Fill your barrel with coal-tar.`
Go to the fractionation still in Rimmington outside of the chemist's house.`
Use the barrel of coal-tar on the still.`
Rotate the tar regulator clockwise twice (don't do a complete rotation), to make the tar flow at maximum. The 'pressure' indicator on the left should go up.`
When the pressure enters the green region, rotate the pressure valve clockwise once to let out some pressure. This should stall the pressure indicator.`
Start adding coal. This raises the 'heat' indicator on the right. If it's below the green region, add more coal. If it's above, don't add coal until it gets lower.`
If the heat reading reaches the dark orange portion, you've spoiled your compound and must start again.`
If you run out of coal, your progress will be saved, but you will have to re-set the pressure to add more coal to it.`
