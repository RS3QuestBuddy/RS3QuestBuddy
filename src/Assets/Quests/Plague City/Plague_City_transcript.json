    "I\u2019m not here to chat.",
    "I protect people like you from the plague.",

    "Then they must be treated immediately.",
    "Any West Ardougnians which cross the wall must be detained and disposed of safely.",
    "Some find it hard, personally I quite enjoy it.",
    "What? I\u2019m pretty sure I haven\u2019t caught the plague yet.",
    "What are you up to?",
    "This is no place for sight-seeing. Don\u2019t you know there\u2019s been a plague outbreak?",
    "Then I suggest you leave as soon as you can.",
    "It\u2019s all down to King Tyras of West Ardougne. Rather than protecting his people he spends his time in the lands to the West. When he returned last he brought the plague with him then left before the problem became serious.",
    "If he did he wouldn\u2019t care. I believe he wants people to suffer, he\u2019s an evil man.",
    "He\u2019s not my king.",
    "The first signs are typical flu symptoms. These tend to be followed by severe nightmares, horrifying hallucinations which drive many to madness.",
    "It gets worse. Next the victim\u2019s blood changes into a thick black tar-like liquid, at this point they\u2019re past help. Their skin is cold to the touch, the victim is now brain dead. Their body however lives on driven by the virus, roaming like a zombie, spreading itself further wherever possible.",

If you're going into West Ardougne you'll need protection from the plague. My wife made a special gasmask for Elena with dwellberries rubbed into it. Dwellberries help repel the virus!
