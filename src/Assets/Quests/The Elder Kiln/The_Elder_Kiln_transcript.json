    "JalYt-[Caste]-[Player], help. My egg is dying.",
    "The egg is cold. Our Mej have tried to heat it, but they say it is too late to save it. But they are wrong. Although many TzHaar eggs are dying now or being born... different, this is big strong egg. It will grow into good strong TzHaar. I just need help. Will you aid us?",
    "You would make good TzHaar, JalYt-[Caste]-[Player]. TzHaar-Mej-Ak. Will you help us?",
    "We must work together to make the egg hatch. Use fire magic to heat the egg and water magic to cool it down. When egg is at right temperature, it will start to hatch.",
    "You JalYt are cold creatures.",
    "It hatches!",
    "No, it cannot be. TzHaar, what is your caste?",
    "No...",
    "But-",
    "TzHaar should not feel a bond with their egg. No one TzHaar is more important than another. But... Through our eggs we live on \u2013 new TzHaar carry dead parent's memories. Now, my memory will not pass on. I am old TzHaar. I will not lay another egg.",
    "TzHaar-Mej-Ak will gather Ga'al and have them fight in the Fight Pit. Ga'al do not know how to fight, so they die.",
    "To die in the Fight Pit is to die with honour. It is far from cruel to a TzHaar.",
    "The Ga'al are weak and useless without memory. They serve no purpose in TzHaar society.",
    "Teach is for JalYt, not TzHaar. How can we teach Ga'al all our years of knowledge? But it has become big problem for TzHaar. So few TzHaar are born now... just more and more Ga'al. We do not know what the cause of it is. TzHaar-Mej have investigated, but to no benefit or great discovery. I have been thinking of something for some time, JalYt-[Caste]-[Player], but it is dangerous and uses old magic. Other TzHaar might not agree. They will say TzHaar-Mej-Jeh does it for his own memories, not for good of TzHaar.",
    "It is a way of giving Ga'al back their memories. Other Mej will not like it. Many think we should not go back... there. But it is the only way. Otherwise, our memories will be lost. We will need a Ga'al \u2013 my Ga'al \u2013 to test this on. You will need to stop him entering the Fight Pit. Bring him to me at the library. There is research I must do before I speak to other TzHaar-Mej about this. Go to Main Plaza in the centre of TzHaar City, west of here, and bring Ga'al back. Convince TzHaar-Mej-Ak if you must.",
    "Thank you, JalYt-[Caste]-[Player]. Bring him to me at the library.",
    "If something has no purpose it must be destroyed. It TzHaar way. We must think of strength of TzHaar society as a whole, not the weakness of separate creatures. (continues above from \"But it has become big problem for TzHaar.\")",
    "Bring my Ga'al to me at the library. TzHaar-Mej-Ak will have taken him to the Main Plaza in the centre of the city.",
    "Ga'al are disease on TzHaar society, JalYt.",
    "Our ways are not your soft ways, JalYt. To die in Fight Pit is great honour for any TzHaar.",
    "We must talk, TzHaar-Mej-Ak. I know how to give memories to the Ga'al.",
    "No!",
    "He died in the Pit. Death in the Pits is not murder, and, if you listened to us, this would not have happened. I have a plan, TzHaar-Mej-Ak...",
    "There is a way to bring the Champion back! [Player], what do you know about TokKul?",
    "When TzHaar die we turn into TokKul: small rocks with our memories trapped inside.",
    "Our memories make it valuable, so TzHaar trade it with each other as currency.",
    "It has never been possible to get memories from TokKul. And TzHaar who have not laid eggs before they turn to TokKul... their memories are lost forever.",
    "What would you say if I told you there was a way of recovering these memories?",
    "It is! Our Kiln has that power, TzHaar-Mej-Ak. The power to forge TokKul, fusing them with the body of another. The Ga'al are empty bodies that we can use.",
    "The Kiln is where TzHaar were first made. Its lava is able to give life and melt down even the hardest of metals.",
    "But it has the power to join TokKul with Ga'al! To bring back lost memories! The JalYt \u2013 it would not have to break our rules \u2013 it could go.",
    "Think of all the TzHaar born without eggs \u2013 all the Ket-Champions, the Mej-Elders whose memories we have in TokKul. We can bring them back.",
    "What else can we do? More and more Ga'al keep being born. If we cannot pass on our memories then it is the end of the TzHaar.",
    "You must journey to the Kiln. You will need to travel through many tunnels, east of Main Plaza. Just south of Birthing Pool there is passage heading to the Kiln entrance. Guards will let you pass.",
    "No, [Player] is right. Ga'al must have its say.",
    "Here is TzHaar-Ket-Yit'tal's TokKul. Take it with you to the Kiln. We shall speak to the other TzHaar-Mej about our plan whilst you are away.",
    "Kiln is very old. The lava inside is powerful and ancient. That we know. Lava will be able to join Ga'al and memories inside TokKul as one.",
    "It is where TzHaar came from in the beginning. We protect it, but do not go inside. It is sacred ground. TzHaar have not even walked down the tunnels leading to Kiln for very long time. They may have become dangerous.",
    "You lost TzHaar-Ket-Yit'tal's TokKul? Lucky we kept some spare.",
    "I trusted you with my plan, [Player]. My trust has not been misplaced.",
    "TzHaar-Ket-Yit'tal, it is you. You have all of your memories?",
    "Then my plan worked! We can turn Ga'al into TzHaar! Our memories will not be lost.",
    "The pain will go; you are strong now. Think of all the TzHaar trapped in TokKul who now can live again. This is the right thing to do.",
    "From now on, we shall call you TzHaar-Ga'al-Xox'tal.",
    "If it is as you say, then it is cruel to leave TzHaar trapped in TokKul. We must free them!",
    "And would you want us to die out, [Player]? This is the only way.",
    "If it is as you say, then it is cruel to leave TzHaar trapped in TokKul. We must free them!",
    "He will come back in time. Thank you, [Player]. As acknowledgement of your help, we now call you Yt'Haar. That mean sacred-cold in TzHaar. Big honour.",
    "We shall send more Ga'al to Kiln. Now Mej will get to work and collect as much TokKul as we can to send with them. You have helped save our race, [Player].",

    "This ring has a piece of TokKul in it. When wearing it, it will guide your hand and make you better when fighting TzHaar, fire creatures and maybe even TokHaar.",
    "My magic taps into the memories in the ring, so you better at fighting like a TzHaar. The magic will fade after time. When this happens, return to me and I will recharge it for you... for a price.",
    "50,000 TokKul for a full recharge. Normally I would do it for free, but we need all the TokKul we can get, as we will soon be sending more Ga'al to the Kiln.",
    "Why do you feel bad, Yt'Haar-[Caste]-[Player]?",
    "Spending TokKul in shops means we have more TokKul to send to the Kiln. TokKul has always been currency, this will not change. You want to know more about TokKul-Zo?",
    "Soon, we will send more Ga'al to the Kiln. As you cleared the way, it should be safe for them now.",

    "I'm not sure. TzHaar live at peace with becoming TokKul when they die. If all TzHaar knew the pain of being TokKul, society would collapse.",
    "They have to stop... they have to...",
    "No, [Player], it is important they know that TzHaar-Ket-Yit'tal burns within me. I have knowledge of how to fight.",
    "Yes. Now, TzHaar-Mej, listen to our story. Listen carefully.",
    "No! Do you not see? You cannot put more Ga'al through the pain I'm in. The constant pressure, the terrible memories of being trapped in TokKul... it is too much.",
    "You do not see! Names and castes are not what is important. You do not understand...",
    "Help me, [Player].",
    "You would let the Ga'al live in constant pain? The TzHaar do not listen to reason, [Player]. Goodbye - you have been a good friend and teacher.",
    "I must go. The TzHaar are blind.",
    "How can you say that? Would you want other Ga'al to suffer like me? This cannot be allowed.",
    "Despite what you say now, you have been a good friend and teacher. Goodbye, [Player].",
    "I must go. The TzHaar are blind.",
    "I am also interested in the Kiln, but not as a tool for the TzHaar's experiments.",
    "You have been a good friend and teacher. Goodbye, [Player].",
    "I must go. The TzHaar are blind.",

    "It has been... a very long time... since outsiders have entered our Kiln.",
    "Let us test your skills... let our sport be glorious.",
    "Come speak with us.",
    "You must be forged of strong rock to repel our... siblings.",
    "Not many visit... our Kiln. We like to test our skills against those who do. Come, human... let us talk a while.",
    "It has been a long time since we have spoken, so forgive us... if we are slow.",
    "Let us talk...",
    "We are... the TokHaar.",
    "We were forged to build the mountains of Gielinor... although they had a different name then. We were forged in this Kiln by our masters.",
    "When our work was done, we built a great mountain around this Kiln and returned to live within it... to await further instruction.",
    "Or, at least... some of us did. Some of us stayed behind in the mountain.",
    "Ah... yes... they call themselves the TzHaar now.",
    "They chose to live within the mountain we had built. They tunnelled through it to build their cities... undermining our great purpose.",
    "On occasion, creatures... like you... have wandered into our home.",
    "Below your feet flows the lava of creation... those who fall into it surrender their shape, memories and language... They become one with the TokHaar...",
    "Many beasts from the surrounding caves have been submerged in our Kiln.",
    "They pollute our resolve... but there are certain advantages... we learn from them.",
    "We do not keep time... human. We were here at the beginning and we are still here.",
    "We have been practicing our skills against one another; honing our strength in anticipation of our masters' return. Combat... is our great pleasure.",
    "Our masters were the designers of this world. They were the architects of the seas and the valleys, the icy lands to the north, the desert plains... and the mountains.",
    "We were their tools... their mountain builders.",
    "They built the Xil to dig up the earth and rock... the Mej to blast it into a size that the Ket could carry... and the Hur to craft the sediment into cliff-faces and slopes.",
    "We remember them... yes... and we shall wait for their return.",
    "Yes...",
    "This is the Great Kiln from which we were forged.",
    "The Kiln was built by our masters to form the mountains. We have completed that task... now we wait for the return of our masters... and new orders.",
    "Within this Kiln flows sacred lava. Through it, we remain constant. If we are destroyed within this place, the lava rises and the Kiln forges us once more.",
    "Through this we are one... our memories shared by the lava. Existence as individuals is only ever... fleeting.",
    "Combat is our pleasure. We wanted to test your abilities in our sport. You have proven quite capable.",
    "It has been such a long time since creatures have wandered into our home. We were... hungry for a challenge.",
    "Ah... yes... they did not return with us... they chose to desecrate the mountain they were destined to build and call themselves TzHaar.",
    "They are the epitome of weakness and corruption.",
    "We were forged to build the mountains. When we finished, most of us returned to this Kiln.",
    "But some stayed behind to live in this mountain instead. They tunnelled through our great work to create their cities and mazes.",
    "It is... unnatural... to live outside of our Kiln. When we are destroyed... we are reforged by the Kiln. Our memories stay as one.",
    "The TzHaar have become so... weak. They pass on their memories through sordidly laying eggs... letting the sacred lava pass from one to another so wastefully.",
    "In the end, they become what they call 'TokKul', often neglecting to pass on their knowledge.",
    "Their memories going to waste... not returning to the sacred lava. They have forgotten their great purpose.",
    "And... why? To build cities of waste... shrines of disrespect to our great cause... to our purpose.",
    "So, you came here with a purpose...",
    "If the TzHaar had remained in our Kiln... they would not have to resort to such foolish endeavours to preserve their memories.",
    "Do you think this little 'Ga'al' can survive such a process? He might melt under the heat and become one with us.",
    "What about you... human? Do you think the little Ga'al should sacrifice itself to hold the TzHaar's memories?",
    "The TzHaar are a corrupt race... although We[sic] can see how they may seem ordered and principled to you. Humans are agents of disorder and anarchy.",
    "If they returned to this Kiln, there would be no Ga'al... no TokKul... no eggs. Their problems would melt away - all by staying true to the original purpose.",
    "But your loyalty... while misguided... is commendable.",
    "But will the Ga'al be better for it?",
    "So, you are the reluctant guardian of this Ga'al? The TzHaar are a corrupt race... and have no doubt deceived this Ga'al to make it undergo such a...process...",
    "We would allow this transformation... only, you do not have the TokKul of the dead champion with you.",
    "We shall allow this transformation to be carried out. Ga'al - stand under the mouth at the entrance to the Kiln.",
    "And embrace the heat.",
    "Ha ha. Not today, although to fight with you would be most...pleasurable. You have provided entertainment and we would like to talk with you a while. It has been a long time since we have spoken, so forgive us...if we are slow. Let us talk...",
    "Nothing you haven't asked for... the creature was just too weak to endure it.",
    "Leave this place... take the Ga'al to the TzHaar... we'll ensure you have some company on your way back... once the Ga'al is with the TzHaar then return to us for a real challenge.",
    "Combat is our pleasure. We wanted to test your abilities in our sport. You have proven quite capable.",
    "It has been such a long time since creatures have wandered into our home. We were... hungry for a challenge.",
    "We would like to meet with you again... we are hungry for more sport. Return the creature back to its masters... finish your business, and then return here if you want a real battle.",
    "Hurry... [Player]... we are hungry for more.",
    "So the TzHaar wouldn't listen... about the pain you've endured... they do not understand the torment of being trapped in TokKul... something must be done...",
    "Let us talk for a while... my little Ga'al...",
    "We apologise. We haven't faced anyone other than ourselves for such a long time. Speaking with you and... meeting... the little TzHaar flared our curiosity. Those you destroyed are lost to us now. It is we who suffered for our sport."
