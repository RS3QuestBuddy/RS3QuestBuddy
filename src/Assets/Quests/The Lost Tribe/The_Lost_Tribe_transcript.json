    "There was recently some damage to the castle cellar. Part of the wall has collapsed. The Duke insists that it was an earthquake, but I think some kind of monsters are to blame. Would you like to help investigate?",
    "You should ask other people around the town if they saw anything.",
    "I'm the Duke's advisor.",
    "I only advise the Duke. But if you want to make yourself useful, there are evil goblins to slay on the other side of the river.",
    "Can I help you?",
    "A goblin? This validates my suspicion! We should tell the Duke!",
    "Yes your grace, but if there is any possibility that this is a goblin incursion then we should take that possibility very seriously!",
    "Your grace, this is the adventurer who defeated the dragon Elvarg. I think you should listen to [him/her].",
    "Can I help you?",
    "See, it was goblins! You should tell the Duke.",
    "It is unknown to me, your grace. But the fact it is there is enough to prove Father Aereck's story. It must have been dropped by a goblin as it fled.",
    "Then it must have been stolen!",
    "That doesn't matter! You said yourself that goblins couldn't have made that, so they must have stolen it from somewhere. Horrible, thieving goblins have broken into our cellar! We must retaliate immediately! First we should wipe out the goblins east of the river, then we can march on the goblin village to the north-west...",
    "Can I help you?",
    "I don't see how there can be any more doubt. You should tell the Duke at once!",
    "What more proof do we need? Nasty, smelly goblins have been living under our feet all this time! We must crush them at once!",
    "Can I help you?",
    "You should tell the Duke about anything you have learned.",
    "And I suppose you believe them, goblin-lover?",
    "Can I help you?",
    "The priceless Lumbridge Silverware! It comes out only on special occasions. It was kept in storage in the cellar, but now the goblins have stolen it.",
    "That doesn't matter. You'll never find it, because the goblins took it. So you can't stop the war!",
    "Can I help you?",
    "What? Well, so what if I am? It's not a crime.",
    "Of...of course not! The goblins must have, um, dropped the silverware as they ran away.",
    "But don't you see it was for the best? For goblins to be living under our feet like this... ugh. It doesn't matter how civilized they are: all sub-human species must be wiped out!",
    "Prattle on, goblin. Soon you will be destroyed!"

    "Make up your minds!",

    "It doesn't really matter. What happened to them?",
    "Who were they fighting again?",
    "Well either way they refused to fight.",
    "Why were there punished again?",
    "So do goblins make their own tunnels?",
    "Well I found a brooch underground, and I looked up the symbol and it was the symbol of the Dorgeshuun.",
    "So why is the Dorgeshuun tribe underground?",
    "Wait, you say YOU won the big wars?",
    "Well why not show me both greetings?",

    "The wall collapsed because of an earthquake. I'm waiting for a team of builders to come and repair it.",
    "Yes, he mentioned that to me. But I think he was imagining things. Goblins live in natural caves but everyone knows they don't have the wit to make their own tunnels.",
    "Hmm, very well. I give you permission to investigate this mystery. If there is a blocked tunnel then perhaps you should try to un-block it.",
    "I've never seen anything like that before. It doesn't come from Lumbridge. What do you think, Sigmund?",
    "I've never heard of a goblin wearing something so well- crafted.",
    "But it wasn't stolen from us. Where could it be from?",
    "I will not commit troops until I have proof that goblins are behind this. Player, please find out what you can about this brooch. The librarian in Varrock might be able to help identify the symbol.",
    "Hmm, perhaps you are right. I will send word to the army to prepare for an underground assault. Player, I would still like you to find out more about this tribe. It cannot hurt to know one's enemy.",
    "Actually, something was taken. Sigmund has informed me that some of the castle silverware is missing from the cellar. Unless it is returned, I am afraid I will have no option but war.",
    "Hmm, I had suspected it. But however much I disapprove of the HAM movement it's not actually illegal. I'll keep an eye on him. though.",
    "Sigmund! Is this your doing?",
    "Don't lie to me! I knew you were a HAM member but I didn't think you would stoop to this. You are dismissed from my service.",
    "That's enough! Get out of my castle now!",
    "I see I was ill-advised. Unless there is an act of aggression by the cave goblins there is no need for war.",
    "You were taking the peace treaty to the cave goblins.",
    "*sigh* All right, here's another copy.",
    "Welcome, Ur-tag. I am sorry that your race came under suspicion. I assure you that the warmongering element has been dealt with.",
    "No, let it stay. It can be a route of commerce between our lands. Player, Lumbridge is in your debt. Please accept this ring as a token of my thanks. It is enchanted to save you in your hour of need."

It looked a bit like a goblin, but it had big bulging eyes. It wasn't wearing armour, but it had this odd helmet with a light on it. The tunnel was too dark for me to follow it, so I went to tell the Duke. But when we went down to the cellar the hole had been blocked up, and no one believes me.",
