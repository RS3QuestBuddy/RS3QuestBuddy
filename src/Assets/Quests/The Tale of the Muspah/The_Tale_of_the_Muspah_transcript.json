  "Erjolf": [
    "Incredible! This'll show them!",
    "Oh! Hello there.",
    "Who, me? No, I'm not excited about anything. I certainly haven't found anything amazing inside the caves here.",
    "Just you hold on a minute. I know what you adventurers are like, you'll wander in there and decide that anything you find is yours to take.",
    "Alright, [grandpa/grandma], you caught me out! If you promise to keep it a secret, I'll show you what I've found.",
    "Great! Then follow me into the caves to see something amazing!",
    "Then, in the name of the Fremennik people, I shall not let you enter the cave!",
    "Well, you can carry on wondering.",
    "My name is Erjolf, you know.",
    "Hey, over here! Jump across the stream to reach me. The flat rock is a good jumping point.",
    "Come on, we're nearly there.",
    "See the ice there, in the middle of the pool? There's something in there. Earlier, when the ice was clearer, I could see spikes. Perhaps it's some long-lost armour! Whatever it is, this could be just what I need to get me through the Fremennik Trials!",
    "you'd know all about that, wouldn't you, [Fremennik name]?",
    "We've all heard of the outerlander who passed the Trials, and here you are! Adventuring with [Fremennik name] - what a day!",
    "There's something in there, I caught a glimpse of it earlier, before the ice frosted over. I'm sure I saw spikes, it was like a fearsome piece of armour.",
    "If I can find something that impresses the Council then I'll pass the Trials and become a man!",
    "I'm proving my worth to my kinsfolk. The Fremennik Trials! Once completed, I will have come of age. I'm having some trouble with some of the tasks, though. I was set a maze task yesterday. I spent all day in there and still couldn't find the way out. I never did have a good sense of direction. I'm sure that if I can get whatever's in the ice it would help me prove my worth. Perhaps it won't even matter that I'm having trouble with Swensen's maze!",
    "You know, I was hoping you would say that. Not that I couldn't do it on my own, you know. It's just that I can see you want to help so much.",
    "No! It's settled. You'll help me.",
    "We need to somehow melt the ice in the middle of the pool. I've had a think about it, and I've come up with a way! I'll show you when you're ready.",
    "Great! Now listen carefully...",
    "We're going to melt the ice in the middle of the pool using an old Fremennik tradition...making boats and setting fire to them! We won't need full-sized boats, of course, a simple raft will do. Then we can light them, and set them in the pool so they drift out to the ice in the middle!",
    "Got it in one!",
    "First I'll show you how to build a raft.",
    "Take a piece of driftwood from one of these piles to make a fire raft.",
    "Watch carefully how I make them. I just take this knife... ...and use it with some driftwood, like this...",
    "...and you get a fire raft! Now to launch it. You need a tinderbox to do this.",
    "There she goes! We just need to figure out how to get the rafts to the ice in the middle. Let's look around the cave. So, here's the ice in the middle of the pool with water flowing around it. If you watch the ice falling in to the pool you can see how the water is flowing. There are four streams around the pool. You can block or clear some streams to adjust the flow.",
    "This is the north stream. Water flows into the pool from here. This is the only stream that feeds the pool.",
    "This is the west stream. Water flows out of the pool, as long as the stream is unblocked. If it is unblocked then nearby fire rafts will move towards it.",
    "This is the south stream. Water flows out of the pool here, just like the west stream.",
    "This is the east stream. Guess what? It's just like the west and south streams. Water flows out of it!",
    "Here's one last tip for you... I can't work out how to melt all the ice, but... If you launch several fire rafts at once, they'll come to rest against each other. That means you'll be able to melt pieces of ice which look difficult to reach by launching several rafts at once. Well, hop to it then! Make some rafts, change the current, and melt the ice.",
    "There you go, now you have all you need to start melting the ice.",
    "Actually, you seem to have all the tools you need for melting the ice already.",
    "Sure! Now listen carefully...",
    "Well done, [Fremennik name]! You've melted the ice! Come and speak to me when you have a moment.",
    "Oh, it isn't a piece of armour at all!",
    "I wonder how it got in there.",
    "But...something's not right. The ice closest to it hasn't melted, not even a bit. Is it some kind of magic? And I don't think I've ever heard of a creature like this before. Not even in stories!",
    "Not a chance! If I could get some kind of trophy from it, that'd impress everyone! The whole Council would vote in my favour, I'd pass the Trials straight away!",
    "Well, I'm a bit disappointed that it's not some flashy armour. But at least it's impressive! If I can just get a trophy from it... but... It's odd that there's still ice around the creature. Perhaps we need some specialist help here.",
    "Hey, I know who we can ask about the frozen creature. A natural historian from a museum is in the area, looking for yetis. Now, where did I see him last... Oh, yes! Up at the Trollweiss Hunter Area! Apparently he's trying to research yetis for the museum in Varrock. I doubt he's having much luck, though: no one will help him find them because he's an outerlander!",
    "Yes. I'd go, but I must stay here and guard the cave. I don't want anyone else getting my trophy!",
    "Before you go to find the natural historian, take a good look at the creature. You'll need to describe it to him so he can tell us more about it.",
    "You're back! What did the natural historian say about the creature?",
    "Well, take a good look at the creature, remember it well so that you can describe it to the natural historian.",
    "You're back! What did the natural historian say about the creature?",
    "Perhaps it would be helpful to visit the statue to see if you can learn more.",
    "Okay, thank you. And take a spade with you; sandstorms may have covered the statue, so there may be some digging to do.",
    "Well, I'm a bit disappointed that it's not some flashy armour. But at least it's impressive! If I can just get a trophy from it... but... It's odd that there's still ice around the creature. Perhaps we need some specialist help here.",
    "You should go to the Kharidian Desert to find the statue the natural historian told you about.",
    "I'll stay here to keep an eye on the creature, of course. I don't want anyone else to find it before I get my trophy.",
    "You're back! What did the natural historian say about the creature?",
    "Of course it exists, it's right here! What else did you find out?",
    "By the gods! So what we have here is a mythical creature? With a trophy from that I'll pass my Trials, for sure.",
    "Oh, it'll be something to do with those powerful mages you mentioned. Don't worry about that, I don't!",
    "Now, you said Ali told you how to thaw the creature? I've managed to build a small bridge out to it.",
    "Hmmm...I'm not much of a magic user, so I can't help you there. Looks like another job for you. Hop to it!",
    "Yes, I'm practising in case I become the Chieftain one day.",
    "How are you getting on with thawing out the creature?",
    "Good stuff. Please hurry, though, there's a bitter chill in here.",
    "You've done it! You've really done it! Thank you so much! Wait there, I'm coming across to you.",
    "Finally I can get my trophy! Just think of the respect I'll get now!",
    "It's...it's alive! Er...I think it's time for my dinner. I really should go.",
    "Is it gone yet? The monster? Only...I really need a trophy from it.",
    "The mountains are really steep and slippy, you'll fall for sure!",
    "Well, I don't have a boat, but you could always make a canoe. You did a good job making those fire rafts, a canoe should be no problem.",
    "Yes, I keep my eyes open, not like you oldies! Meet me on the west coast on the Trollweiss Hunter Area, near where all the land all turns to snow. And bring a hatchet with you!",
    "Ha! I got here much faster than you.  I've been waiting ages!",
    "No, I'm not! I didn't run here really fast just to beat you.",
    "You should use the great big log over there.",
    "Yes, and don't forget about my trophy!",
    "Nice canoe! I knew you'd do a good job. I'd have made a better one though.",
    "Anyway, how are you doing at getting me a trophy?",
    "If you think I'm going home without a trophy, then you're wrong.",
    "Really? You're great!",
    "It's the best! I can't wait to show this off, I'll pass the Fremennik Trials, for sure!",
    "Oh, yeah, about that... It'd probably be best to keep this on the quiet, yeah? Otherwise I might not get all the credit I deserve.",
    "No, no, not at all! Just...don't mention it to anyone.",
    "Fair enough. I thought it might be a bit much to ask. Well, see you around!"

  "Player": [
    "Hello?",
    "You seem rather excited about something.",
    "You won't mind if I have a look inside the cave, then.",
    "I thought there was nothing in the caves to get excited about.",
    "Okay, your secret is safe with me.",
    "No thanks, I don't like secrets.",
    "(I wonder what he's hiding down there?)",
    "Hello again, weird-secret-cave-boy.",
    "Okay. Hey, Erjolf...",
    "You've heard of me?",
    "Why are you excited about the ice?",
    "Why is that important to you?",
    "Tell me more about your Trials.",
    "Perhaps I can help with your Trials.",
    "Er...well, if you'd rather-",
    "Okay, what do I need to do?",
    "I'm ready to learn how to melt the ice.",
    "You want me to build rafts then set them on fire and launch them?",
    "Never mind.",
    "I need some tools to melt the ice.",
    "Thanks!",
    "Can you remind me how to melt the ice?",
    "A frozen monster...",
    "Perhaps it got trapped in an avalanche.",
    "So...you leave it alone and get on with the Trials?",
    "What do you make of the creature in the ice?",
    "What should we do now?",
    "So I should go to the Trollweiss Hunter Area and speak to this natural historian?",
    "I guess I'll be going to find the natural historian on my own, then.",
    "Oh, I haven't found him yet.",
    "Okay, thank you.",
    "Never mind.",
    "Hello.",
    "Are you any good at identifying creatures?",
    "It's because of a curious creature I've found, I'm trying to find out what it is.",
    "Okay, I can start describing it now.",
    "It's blue.",
    "It's red.",
    "It's yellow.",
    "I'll come back later.",
    "It has two arms.",
    "It has four arms.",
    "It has six arms.",
    "It has no legs, like a snail.",
    "It has four legs, like a mammal.",
    "It has eight legs, like a spider.",
    "It has a smooth skull.",
    "It has spikes, which run down its spine.",
    "It has unkempt hair flowing down its head.",
    "It's like a scorpion's stinging tail.",
    "It has a spiky tail, with vicious spines.",
    "It's a bit like a fish tail.",
    "It has pincers, like a crab.",
    "It has three big fingers on each hand.",
    "It has webbed skin between its talons.",
    "I must have made a mistake.",
    "Yes, I'll try to describe it again.",
    "No, I need to remind myself what it looks like first.",
    "What is the creature I described?",
    "Can you tell me what it is, then?",
    "What do you mean?",
    "Where can I find out more about this creature?",
    "A statue in the desert? Whereabouts?",
    "It's certainly worth a go. The desert is a fair distance off, though.",
    "Thanks!",
    "I need to remind myself what it looks like first.",
    "Don't you know what a yeti looks like?",
    "Why's that?",
    "What are you doing here?",
    "You're quite far from home, aren't you?",
    "What exactly are you researching?",
    "So you're trying to make a yeti exhibit?",
    "Sounds fun!",
    "Never mind.",
    "Hello again.",
    "Okay, I can start describing it now.",
    "Where can I find out more about this creature?",
    "A statue in the desert? Whereabouts?",
    "It's certainly worth a go. The desert is a fair distance off, though.",
    "I've lost the teletab you gave me.",
    "Okay, I'll use the teletab you gave me.",
    "Where is the statue you talked about?",
    "It was most curious. He's never heard of the creature in real life before, but he did say it's similar to a statue they've heard about in the Kharidian Desert.",
    "Of course. I'll have a good look near the Desert Mining Camp.",
    "What do you make of the creature in the ice?",
    "What should we do now?",
    "And what will you do?",
    "Never mind.",
    "Oh, hello. Have you been looking for this statue, too?",
    "Who are you?",
    "And this statue is knowledge?",
    "Why are you interested in the statue?",
    "You came along at just the right time then, I've only just dug it out of the sand.",
    "You're really pleased with the statue, aren't you?",
    "I've found a creature just like this statue.",
    "Well, it's a rather strange story. My Fremennik ally, Erjolf, found the body entombed in ice, but I can't seem to melt all the ice around it. Then I asked a natural historian about the creature.",
    "Well, he said he had heard a rumour about this statue, too, and when I described my creature to him, he realised that this must be a statue of the very same monster. So I've come here to find out more about it, hoping to find a way to melt the remaining ice.",
    "Wonderful! So tell me all about it.",
    "So why haven't I heard of this creature before? I've never even heard rumours about it.",
    "Why do you think the creature I've found is a myth?",
    "Go on...",
    "If the Muspah is a myth, how could I have found it? The natural historian said it was a myth, too, but it doesn't make any sense. I've seen it with my own eyes!",
    "How can I clear the ice from around the Muspah? Erjolf needs a trophy from it to earn his rite of passage.",
    "Of course!",
    "Does that mean I need to use magic to remove the ice?",
    "I've practised Magic enough to be able to do that. What exactly do I need to do?",
    "Okay, I think I can manage that.",
    "Can you help me get back to the Muspah's cave?",
    "It's to the east of Rellekka.",
    "Thanks!",
    "I guess I'll walk then.",
    "Never mind.",
    "It was most curious. The natural historian said the creature was a myth, and couldn't really exist.",
    "I met Ali the Wise in the desert. He told me even more...",
    "Doesn't it bother you? Not knowing how it came to be here, I mean.",
    "Err...if you're sure.",
    "Yes. I can bore gemstones in to the ice and then enchant them.",
    "Ha! You're becoming quite bossy, aren't you?",
    "I'm still working on it.",
    "Wait, come back! What about your trophy?",
    "He's young; I suppose I should have expected him to run at the first sign of trouble.",
    "You... you can talk!",
    "(Perhaps if I edge slowly out of the cave...)",
    "Oh, hello there. Er...you have got quite a few arms. I should know, I counted them.",
    "Now I can answer those questions, at least. You're somewhere near Trollweiss Mountain, where you were found sleeping in a block of ice.",
    "As for what kind of creature you are, I had to get some expert help on that. And the expert says that you're a Muspah.",
    "Er...good?",
    "Er...",
    "Your...head...what are you?",
    "Okay, don't worry, I'm going.",
    "Feeling weak, eh? Well, whether you're strong or not, it costs nothing to show a little gratitude.",
    "I only wanted to help!",
    "Hey!",
    "That's okay. I guess some people just find it difficult to wake up.",
    "What happened? You were a strange creature before...",
    "And when you started to dream about it you changed into it?",
    "You look a bit...unusual.",
    "Rejuvenation?",
    "What were you doing in the ice?",
    "But why?",
    "Tell me about the rejuvenation ritual.",
    "You mean to say that the Mahjarrat kill each other?",
    "Ah! So, you've been hiding in the ice!",
    "You've been alive for thousands of years?",
    "I...I had no idea. You must have seen so much.",
    "So what do you need now?",
    "Good luck with hibernating, then.",
    "I've started, so I may as well finish. What do I need to do?",
    "Okay, I need four sapphires, the runes to enchant them and a knife?",
    "And where should I meet you?",
    "How will I do that?",
    "Good for you.",
    "Never mind.",
    "It'll take more than that to make amends.",
    "We'll see.",
    "Fine! You're on your own!",
    "Never mind.",
    "Hey, Erjolf?",
    "Listen, I need to find some way of travelling round the coast.",
    "Then how about travelling by water?",
    "Any idea where I can find a log to make one?",
    "I had better go and find Erjolf.",
    "Erjolf is going to show me where to make a canoe.",
    "I'll see you there.",
    "What will you do now?",
    "Is that how you spend all your time? Wandering the desert?",
    "Perhaps I'll see you in Nardah one day, then.",
    "The Muspah isn't what it appeared to be!",
    "It's changed into another creature. It turned out to be alive all along, and once I'd freed it, it... changed. It told me it was a Mahjarrat. suddenly see its head was a skull.",
    "He's called Jhallan. He says he's weak and wants to hibernate under the Mahjarrat ritual site. Apparently the Mahjarrat perform a ritual there which will rejuvinate them.",
    "Okay, I'll go and find out all I can.",
    "Hi again.",
    "You seem a bit out of breath to be honest.",
    "Anyway, I'm more interested in making a canoe.",
    "Okay, I'll get to work.",
    "Here I go again, making boats. I better not set fire to this one though.",
    "I'm sure you would.",
    "I'm still working on it.",
    "Hello, I made it!",
    "You seem to be in pretty bad shape.",
    "Well, how about right here?",
    "Yes, follow me. We'll find somewhere you can rest.",
    "No, I don't have time for this right now.",
    "Hello again.",
    "Is this spot peaceful enough for you?",
    "Perhaps if I killed the creatures first?",
    "Okay, here I go again.",
    "Can you stop following me? I have something else to do.",
    "So, that's it then? I won't see you again, I suppose.",
    "It's not that, I just... Things just don't seem complete, you know?",
    "Well, usually in an adventure things wrap up nicely at the end. But this time... I started out promising to help Erjolf with his Trials, but I don't seem to have helped him at all.",
    "Oh, well, I imagine he'll just try to find you again to get some kind of trophy.",
    "And, of course, he knows how to bring you out of hibernation, he just needs to practise his magic a bit...",
    "Still, as long as you're happy with him waking you up again...",
    "Wonderful! That should do just fine, thanks!",
    "The Muspah isn't what it appeared to be!",
    "It's changed into another creature. It turned out to be alive all along, and once I'd freed it, it... changed. It told me it was a Mahjarrat. suddenly see its head was a skull.",
    "He's called Jhallan. He said he was weak and wanted to hibernate under the Mahjarrat ritual site. Apparently the Mahjarrat perform a ritual there which will rejuvinate them. I found him somewhere peaceful to rest again.",
    "Still hanging around here?",
    "It just so happens I have something for you here.",
    "So this is your place?",
    "You told me how to thaw out the Muspah, I thought I should keep my part of the bargain.",
    "To start with, the Muspah wasn't what it appeared to be. It turned out to be alive all along, and once I'd freed it, it... changed. It told me it was a Mahjarrat. It was quite a shock to suddenly see its head was a skull.",
    "Yes, he's called Jhallan. He was incredibly weak and wanted to hibernate under the Mahjarrat ritual site. I found him somewhere peaceful and put him back to sleep. Apparently the ritual will rejuvenate any Mahjarrat nearby.",
    "So, do you think the Muspah's tail is a good enough trophy?",
    "Glad I could help.",
    "You want me to lie about helping you?",
    "I'm making no promises.",
    "Bye.",
    "Hello, I've come to claim a reward.",
    "I've managed to locate the statue of the Muspah.",
    "Are you still looking for yetis?",
    "Perhaps you'll have better luck with the desert statue."
  ],
  "Natural historian": [
    "Ah ha! Oh...you're not a yeti...are you?",
    "I am rather good. Why do you ask?",
    "Oh, I'm sure I can help you. Now, I'll ask you questions about the creature, you tell me the answers, and let's see if we can figure out what it is.",
    "Then let's get started!",
    "To start with, what colour is the creature?",
    "Okay, we'll try again when you're ready.",
    "Okay, and how many arms does it have?",
    "Okay, now how many legs does it have?",
    "Tell me about its head.",
    "Now could you describe its tail, please?",
    "We're nearly there, just one more question. Tell me what its hands are like please.",
    "Oh dear, that doesn't sound right at all. I don't think I've ever heard of anything like that.",
    "Would you like to have another go now?",
    "Then let's get started!",
    "Okay, pop back when you're ready.",
    "Oh my! Well that sounds like... But it can't be...",
    "I must say, the creature you've described to me is most puzzling.",
    "I can try, but I'm afraid it's as much of a mystery to me as it is to you.",
    "Well, this is a mythical creature. Just consider the way it's built, nothing like that could really exist. I've never heard of a real creature such as this, it's the kind of being you'd find in folk tales.",
    "I'm unable to say, I doubt any natural historian can help you. I do have one piece of information which may help, though. On my field trips I hear many reports of interesting finds. One such report was of a statue found in the Kharidian Desert which had a remarkable similarity to the creature you've described to me.",
    "That's just it, other people went looking for it, but never found it. The rumour said it was east of the Desert Mining Camp. If you could find the statue, perhaps you'll be able to learn more about the creature. If you let me know where it is, I have a small reward I can give you for your effort.",
    "I can help you get some of the way there at least. Here's a teletab which will take you to Lumbridge. You can use it regardless of your Magic level.",
    "Okay, pop back when you're ready.",
    "Of course I know. Great big thing. Covered in white fur. A hunched posture, generally. Quite a roar on it. It's just that I'm keeping an open mind at the moment.",
    "Well, I've been out here so long and I've never seen so much as a yeti track, never mind the actual creature itself. I'm starting to wonder if people are just imagining them. You know, someone spots a kebbit in the distance at sundown, but the shadow makes it look much bigger... The next thing you know, they've got yeti rumours rippling out across the whole continent.",
    "I'm doing valuable research work for the Varrock Museum.",
    "Oh, yes. For me, this is where the real museum is! Not stuffed away in echoing galleries or writing exhibit cards in an ill-lit cupboard.",
    "I'm trying to find out about yetis for the Varrock Museum. There's a whole exhibit there dedicated to natural history.",
    "Yes, the displays in the museum are most impressive, you know. Instead of just reading about different creatures they have moving models of them, so you really get an idea of what the animals are like.",
    "Oh, yes. You should definitely visit the Varrock Museum!",
    "Oh! You were telling me about that creature you found in the ice. Would you like to try describing it to me again?",
    "Then let's get started. To start with, what colour is the creature?",
    "I'm unable to say, I doubt any natural historian can help I do have one piece of information which may help, though. On my field trips I hear many reports of interesting finds.

    "If you use the teletab I gave you, that will take you as far as Lumbridge at least.",
    "Oh dear. And that was my last one, too. Well, I suppose you'll be travelling to the desert on the shoe express, then!"
  ],
  "Native historian": [
    "Oh! Well, that ended rather abruptly. Come and speak to me again when you want to describe the creature."
  ],
  "Ali the Wise": [
    "So that's where it is...and to think I've been searching far and wide.",
    "Come and speak to me when you have a moment and we'll discuss it more.",
    "That's just what I'm looking for. Is the statue not splendid?",
    "They call me Ali the Wise, and I explore the desert in my eternal quest for knowledge.",
    "Indeed, from my cursory glance I can see that it is incredibly old... Perhaps it can tell us something about the beings who created the statue.",
    "I heard a rumour about it and, inquisitive as I am, I came searching for it.",
    "That would explain why I haven't found it before, even though I've passed this way many times. The sand storms in this area are particularly bad. It may have been covered and uncovered thousands of times over the years. And look what I've missed out on - such magnificence! Such tremendous masonry!",
    "I shall study it without delay!",
    "Hold there, adventurer! That cannot be! Do you mean to tell me that you have found such a creature in the flesh?",
    "Very interesting, please continue.",
    "You would normally be hard pressed to learn much about the creature. But happily you have stumbled upon my wise and learned self.",
    "The creature you have found is the Muspah. It is a fearsome predator, designed by a cruel and archaic god.",
    "Because, my dear adventurer, it doesn't exist.",
    "It's certainly puzzling, but I will explain what I can. This plane is inhabited by many different races, and through my explorations and investigations I have come to understand them well. Each of these races has their own folk tales and fables, it is simply a part of culture.",
    "One little known race, which has now become very rare, travelled to this plane from a distant and cruel world. They brought with them their strange ways, rituals and folk tales. It is one of these folk tales that speaks of the Muspah. From various inscriptions I've read, the tale is of a creator-god who combined his most fearsome creatures to produce a monster the likes of which is unknown to this world. In truth, however, this creature would not work. As fearsome as it appears, it would actually be fairly easy to destroy. It is a terror of the mind, not of the flesh.",
    "That I cannot say. The race of which I speak are terribly powerful mages, though, it is likely that some of their magic is at work here.",
    "Now, let me ponder this... It would certainly save me the trouble of investigating this myself... Okay, I'll teach you a special way to clear the ice from around the Muspah, but on one condition: you must return and tell me everything you discover.",
    "Excellent. If I am not here when you return, you shall find me at my house in Nardah. Now then, given the creature and the race, it is likely that the ice is somehow magically imbued.",
    "Indeed. It's nice to see you pick things up so quickly. A simple Enchant Sapphire spell will suffice.",
    "You'll need four sapphires to enchant. Uncut sapphires won't work, they'll need to be cut first. Take four sapphires, four cosmic runes and four water runes to the Muspah. Use a knife to bore the gems into the ice around the Muspah, and cast the enchantment on each gem. That will focus any magic away from the creature, allowing the ice to melt.",
    "Hmmm... Whereabouts is it?",
    "Well, I can get you to Camelot, at least - I have a teletab which will take you there.",
    "I'm sorry, I don't have any more teletabs for you.",
    "Sounds like good exercise!",
    "I will continue to study and sketch the statue for a while, before returning to Nardah to archive my findings. Then I shall be off out in to the desert again to find out what other treasures it holds.",
    "Yes, although I have my den in Nardah, I am not there often. I usually only return there to store artefacts I find and to write up my notes.",
    "Indeed. If I am not here when you return then you'll find me waiting in Nardah, eager to hear about your adventure. And now, if you'll excuse me, I shall record this magnificent find before another sand storm conceals it again.",
    "Oh! So you have some information for me? I must record this!",
    "I did not confide in you earlier, adventurer, but I did perhaps wonder if that would be the case. Remember I said the creature was a myth? I wondered if one of the powerful mages I mentioned had somehow changed in to Muspah form.",
    "I advise you to make the most of this opportunity. You should try to communicate further with the creature to see what you can learn.",
    "Oh! So you have some information for me? I must record this!",
    "I did not confide in you earlier, adventurer, but I did perhaps wonder if that would be the case. Remember I said the creature was a myth? I wondered if one of the powerful mages I mentioned had somehow changed in to Muspah form.",
    "What a curious character! Well, at least we know where to find him, should we ever need to.",
    "Humble but homely, I think. It suits me well. How good to see you again!",
    "Oh! So you have some information for me? I must record this!",
    "The Muspah creature was a Mahjarrat in disguise?",
    "We know where to find him again, should we ever need to. Well, that creature in the ice has given me much to think about. I've started to research these Mahjarrat; I'm worried they may be a threat to us humans. We need to collaborate to gather as much information as possible."

    "Do you see, human? Does your mind race to comprehend what I have become?",

    "Begone, human, I have plans to make. I do not need your bleating to distract me.",
    "Hmmm...beneath me my legs buckle so. Have I lost so much strength through my slumbering years?",
    "Do you still plague me with your feeble mind?",
    "Help, eh? Now, let me think... I suppose in this weakened state I could use a drudge such as this.",
    "Oh! Did I say that aloud? Forgive me, I am tired. I was merely admiring your patience, adventurer. I apologise for my ill manners - I was rather startled, you see.",
    "Yes, I was also taken by surprise by that, if you recall. During my slumber, I must have dreamt of the Muspah: an horrific creature from my people's imagination. It is a mythical being from our folk tales.",
    "Yes. My race is highly skilled at taking on the shape of other beings. It is incredibly strenuous to achieve, though; I weep when I think about how much of my power the transformation must have consumed.",
    "This is what we Mahjarrat become in the long, tired years leading up to our rejuvenation.",
    "Yes, for years I have been waiting in the ice, growing ever weaker, waiting to be filled with power once more.",
    "I was hibernating, a most difficult feat.",
    "It is to do with our ritual of rejuvenation.",
    "Ah, the ritual that brings energy anew to us Mahjarrat. Such a shame that one of our kind must be sacrificed, but it is a small price to pay really.",
    "Oh, it's nothing as uncivilised as slaughter. We do battle, although I fear my enemies plot and scheme against me. This is why I could not take part in the ritual. I am too weak to fend off my foes. And, so, I concealed myself under the ritual site, that I may be rejuvenated without fear.",
    "How long have you been in this realm, human? I have been here many years. I stopped counting after a few thousand.",
    "Yes. And, in that time, can you imagine the destruction I have seen? There was a time when what you call the Wilderness was a paradise blessed by the gods. There was a time when this whole world was at war. I have seen Zamorak stride across the battlefield, a storm of hate and wrath and fire.",
    "Indeed, and what I have seen has tempered me somewhat. I am weary of battle now.",
    "I must hibernate again under the ritual site. There are caves beneath it, but this time I must choose my resting place with more care. This time my rest must not be disturbed. I must not dream of the Muspah again. Transforming into that creature used almost all the energy I have.",
    "Wait there, human! I do not have the power to go into hibernation again. I need you to help me.",
    "Use the same process you used to awaken me. That should allow me to focus the remaining power I have to send me into a slumber again.",
    "Exactly. You learn well, for a human.",
    "You will need to find a way to the caves beneath the ritual site.",
    "Why not ask your little Fremennik friend? He waits just without this cave. I smell his fear!",
    "I understand your rage. I regret I have nothing to offer you as recompense. Perhaps you could wait until you've calmed down, then speak to me again?",
    "Yes, and I rather prefer things that way.",
    "Splendid. You can use it to travel to the caves under the ritual site. I shall teleport myself there, rather than risking sea travel.",
    "And not a moment too soon. My...legs are about to give way, I...can scarcely even think.",
    "Yes, but now I have arrived! This central point is...directly beneath the ritual stone. You can even feel its force...seeping through the mountain. You will need to do my thinking for me here. Guide me...to a place where I can rest.",
    "I'm afraid not. I need somewhere that's...ice cold, where I won't be disturbed by running water or creatures, and that...isn't too light. And not in a tunnel, either! I don't want to be...disturbed while sleeping!",
    "Are you ready to guide me to a peaceful...hibernation spot now?",
    "Yes, oh brave adventurer?",
    "I'm afraid not, I may be disturbed if I'm somewhere...people might walk.",
    "I'm afraid not, here it is too warm. Do you not see...the absence of ice? I could not sustain hibernation here.",
    "I'm afraid not, here it is too light. The rays would...penetrate the ice around me, and cause me...to dream again. Who knows what I would...become were that to occur again!",
    "I'm afraid not, the hideous creatures here would...disturb me in my slumber. I must have complete peace. You saw with your own...eyes what became of me last time I was disturbed.",
    "That will not do at all. They would soon...return, as creatures do. Instead you must find me somewhere completely...peaceful.",
    "I'm afraid not. The sound from the streams would disturb...me in my slumber. I must have complete peace. You saw with your own...eyes what became of me the last time I was disturbed.",
    "I need somewhere that's...ice cold, where I won't be disturbed by running water or creatures, and that...isn't too light. And not in a tunnel, either! I don't want...to be disturbed while sleeping!",
    "How wonderful. Yes, I think this...shall do very nicely. Now, if you would be so kind as to bore...the sapphires in around me.",
    "As you wish. Pray...be swift, I feel my strength draining...as we speak.",
    "At last, I...can rest again.",
    "Do not get sentimental, human.",
    "No, I do not know. Explain...yourself.",
    "I cannot help that. Nor do I...care for this Erjolf.",
    "That cannot be allowed! I must...not be disturbed!",
    "Curses! A pox on all adventurers...and their meddling ways!",
    "Pah! I am left with...no choice. Imagine how much this...will pain me, human, weak as I am. I use all...the strength I have left to conjure a trophy for you. Behold, the tail...of the Muspah!",
    "And now, continue...with the hibernation."
