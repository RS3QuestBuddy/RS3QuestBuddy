    "Who are you? Who seeks audience with the King of this fair land of Miscellania?",
    "Ah, it pleases me to see such enthusiasm! I was once an adventurer such as yourself; even while fulfilling my duties as King of Miscellania, I would roam the lands in search of adventure, and strike down mighty foes with a single blow! Unfortunately, I was a little too daring, and attempted to brave the icelands, where I finally met my match. I survived, barely, but I was cursed for the rest of my life to stay in this form. Which leaves me incapable of performing my duties as ruler. This is why I am looking for an exceptional soul to be regent of this fair kingdom of Miscellania.",
    "Hahaha! You are bold, [Fremennik name], but then I have yet to see a good ruler who was not. You will first have to demonstrate your worth. You are a good warrior, that I do not doubt; however ruling also requires a good grasp of diplomacy. We have been at war with neighbouring Etceteria for hundreds of years; however, I think both of us have rather lost our appetite for hostilities. Now may be an opportune time to make amends. If you manage to negotiate peace with them, then you will truly have shown your skill as a diplomat.",
    "Wait! There is one more matter to discuss... a mere formality, of course. By Miscellanious tradition, one may not become ruler of the kingdom if one is not part of the royal family. You will have to convince either my daughter, Princess Astrid, or my son, Prince Brand, to marry you.",
    "I am sure they won't be able to resist your heroic charms. You can ask Ghrim for advice; that's what he's here for, after all.",
    "I can assure you that I managed to heed that same call, and ruling this land was no hindrance to me. However, I understand your decision. Fare thee well!",
    "How are you getting on, [Fremennik name]? Have you talked to Queen Sigrid of Etceteria?",
    "Hmph! You can tell her I'll officially recognise her country as soon as she changes the Etceterian national anthem.",
    "It's insulting! The title alone, \"You're Stupid, We're the Best\", should be enough to give you an idea!",
    "How are you getting on, [Fremennik name]? Have you convinced Sigrid yet?",
    "How are you getting on, [Fremennik name]? Have you convinced Sigrid yet?",
    "I doubt I will be able to hold an ordinary pen well enough to sign the treaty. You will have to find a pen large enough for me to hold.",
    "How are you getting on, [Fremennik name]? Have you found me a pen yet?",
    "How are you getting on, [Fremennik name]? Have you found me a pen yet?",
    "Excellent! And now, with a flourish, I sign the end of the rivalry between our two proud kingdoms! Now, has either of my children agreed to marry you?",
    "Well, keep at it then!",

    "King Vargas was once a brave and noble adventurer, well-loved by his subjects. Unfortunately, he was cursed while seeking a quest in the icelands to the north, and is now unable to reign.",
    "Prince Brand has always dreamed of becoming a famous bard; unfortunately, his musical and literary skills are somewhat lacking. He has no interest in ruling the kingdom, and seems to spend his time daydreaming or composing quite awful poems, and sagas of totally mundane events. He is rather vain, if you'll pardon my saying so; he will greatly appreciate any compliments on his poetry. He also has quite a sweet tooth.",
    "Princess Astrid thinks she'd be perfectly capable of ruling the kingdom, but her father doesn't trust her enough by herself. Especially since she devotes herself to the - as the King sees it - cowardly skill of archery rather than the noble skill of melee combat... She is fond of jewellery, and of course she collects bows. She is also quite the conversationalist. She has many admirers, but has yet to be impressed by any of them.",
    "Queen Sigrid is quite envious of King Vargas, since he has the larger kingdom. The King and she have never seen eye-to-eye, but I think if you approach her you may find her quite reasonable.",

    "If you bring me another, I can correct it. Are there any other matters in which I may be of assistance?",
    "Yes, sir. We are gathered here today to witness the rise of a new hero to the regency of the Kingdom of Miscellania, to continue the work of our great King Vargas who is unfortunately now no longer able to rule. By the powers invested in me by the Miscellaneous Constitution, I declare thee, [Fremennik name], to be the new Regent of this fair kingdom.
