  "Dr. Fenkenstrain": [
    "Have you come to apply for the job?",
    "I'll have to ask you some questions first.",
    "How would you describe yourself in one word?",
    "Mmmm, I see.",
    "Just one more question. What would you say is your greatest skill?",
    "Mmmm, I see.",
    "Looks like you're just the [man/woman] for the job! Welcome aboard!",
    "Yes, there is. You're highly skilled at grave-digging, yes?",
    "Excellent. Now listen carefully. I need you to find some...stuff...for me.",
    "That's what I said...stuff.",
    "Well...dead stuff.",
    "I need you to get me enough dead body parts for me to stitch together a complete body, which I plan to bring to life.",
    "The soil of Morytania is unique in its ability to preserve the bodies of the dead, which is one reason why I have chosen to carry out my experiments here. I recommend digging up some graves in the local area. To the south-east you will find the Haunted Woods; I believe there are many graves there. There is also a mausoleum on an island west of this castle. I expect the bodies that are buried there to be extremely well preserved, as they were wealthy in life.",
    "I need you to get me enough dead body parts for me to stitch together a complete body, which I plan to bring to life.",
    "I came to the land of Morytania many years ago, to find a safe sanctuary for my experiments. This abandoned castle suited my purposes exactly.",
    "Oh, perfectly innocent experiments \u2013 for the good of mankind.",
    "Enough questions, now. Get back to your work.",
    "No, my friend. I have a very special purpose in mind for this creature.",
    "What do you think you're doing???",
    "I can't use this head, [Player]. It's missing the most important part \u2013 the old grey matter.",
    "Great, you've brought me some arms.",
    "Excellent, you've brought me some legs.",
    "Splendid, you've brought me a torso.",
    "Fantastic, you've brought me a head.",
    "Superb! Those are all the parts I need. Now to sew them together... Oh bother! I haven't got a needle or thread! Go and get me a needle, and I'll need 5 lots of thread.",
    "Where are my needle and thread, [Player]?",
    "Ah, a needle. Wonderful.",
    "Some thread. Excellent.",
    "Perfect. But I need one more thing from you \u2013 flesh and bones by themselves do not make life.",
    "I have honed to perfection an ancient ritual that will give life to this creature, but for this I must harness the very power of Nature.",
    "The power of lightning.",
    "Silence your insolent tongue! The storm that brews overhead will create the lightning. What I need you to do is to repair the lightning conductor on the balcony above.",
    "Repair the conductor and BEGONE!!",
    "Oh, it would be easier to do it myself! If you find a conductor mould you should be able to cast a new one. Remember this, [Player], my experiment will only work with a conductor made from silver.",
    "Yes, I'm afraid it did, [Player] \u2013 all too well.",
    "I tricked it into going up to the Tower, and there it remains, imprisoned.",
    "...oh, what have I done...",
    "I have no control over it! It's coming to get me!",
    "Destroy it!!! Take the key to the Tower and take back the life I never should have granted!!!",
    "So have you destroyed it?!?",
    "Please, hurry \u2013 save me!!!",
    "So have you destroyed it?!?",
    "Oh my, oh my, this is exactly what I feared! Why did you have to pick Rologarth's brain of all brains?!?",
    "No! I refuse to release you! You must help me build another creature to destroy this dreadful mistake!!",

    "Oi could tell you a few things about old Fenky, yeah.",
    "Once, this castle were full o' good folk \u2013 my friends. Fenky was just the castle doctor, you know, to the lord and the castle folk. I don't know what happened to them all, but one by one they all disappeared. When they were gone a while, I went an dug graves for 'em in the forest. After a while there weren't no one left, but the lord, Fenkenstrain and meself. Old Fenky sent me into the forest to dig 'im a pit \u2013 never said what for \u2013 then would you believe it, someone chops me 'ead off.",
    "Before oi kicked the bucket, you mean?",
    "Don't worry yerself. I'm not worried about bein' dead. Worse things could happen, I suppose. One thing I do know is, there ain't no lord of the castle anymore, 'cept for old Fenky. Makes ya think a bit, don't it?",
    "Oi was in the old 'aunted Forest to the south, diggin' a pit for moi old master, old Fenkenstrain, when would you believe it, someone chops me head off. Awful bad luck weren't it?",

    "A conductor mould, you say? Let me see... There used to be a bloke 'ere, sort of an 'andyman 'e was. Did everything 'round the place \u2013 fixed what was broke, swept the chimneys and the like. He would 'ave had a mould, I imagine.",

    "It was my birthright, passed down to me through the ages, its origin forgotten. The Ring of Charos has many powers, but Fenkenstrain has bent them to his own evil purposes. Without the power of the ring, he will not be able to raise the dead from their sleep. It has one other, extremely important use \u2013 it confuses the werewolves' senses, making them believe that they smell one of their own kind. Without the ring, Fenkenstrain will be at their mercy."

  "Rologarth": [
    "How goes it, friend?",

    "No, you keep it, my friend. Werewolves hunger for the scent of live flesh \u2013 I have no need for the ring. I have my castle back, if not my soul."
