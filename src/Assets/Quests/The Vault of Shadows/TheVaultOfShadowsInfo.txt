Pylon or Shadow Anchors`
For this next step (The Shadow Button), you will either need to have activated all the shadow anchors or wait until the Kharid-et pylons are active. As of June 17, 2022 the pylon is only active about once every 16–24 hours on average, so it is usually best to charge the Shadow Anchors (you will want to do this eventually anyway, so might as well get it out of the way now). However, if Pylon activation is close (90% or more),`
it might be worth waiting for it, though you should still put any batteries (10 each) towards charging the anchors instead of the pylon (as 10 batteries is only +0.01% toward activation) just in case you are not able to finish in the 30 minutes. To obtain fast batteries, you can repeat Zarosian I collection for Soran, Emissary of Zaros in Varrock. `
He will give you 20 batteries each time you repeat the collection (after the first time). You will need 80 batteries in total to charge all 8 Shadow Anchors.`
