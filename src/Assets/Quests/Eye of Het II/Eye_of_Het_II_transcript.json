    "Zamorak - you don't want alternative to your necromancers being used at the fronts. I think you tried to take the relic to prevent Icthlarin from replacing you.",

    "How fares Icthlarin in his relic hunt?",

    "News of such a disaster travels fast. My people in Al Kharid were some of the first on the scene, looking for survivors.",
    "An earthquake, was it not? Or...ah, I see. You suspect some divine involvement?",
    "A sensible choice. But I'm afraid I cannot help. My forces are completely occupied at the fronts. Even if I wished to interfere, I simply don't have the resources for it now.",
    "What of Icthlarin's prize?",
    "Hmm. I admire his intentions, but...",
