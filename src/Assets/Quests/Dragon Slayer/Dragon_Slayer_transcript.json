  "Guildmaster": [
    "You have not proved yourself worthy to enter here yet.",
    "Greetings bold adventurer. Welcome to the guild of Champions.",
    "Greetings!",
    "This is the Champions' Guild. Only adventurers who have proved themselves worthy by gaining influence from quests are allowed in here.",
    "Aha! Yes! A mighty and perilous quest fit only for the most powerful champions! And, at the end of it, you will earn the right to wear the legendary rune platebody!",
    "You'll have to speak to Oziach, the maker of rune armour. He sets the quests that champions must complete in order to wear it. Oziach lives in a hut, by the cliffs to the west of Edgeville. He can be a little...odd...sometimes, though.",
    "Very well. Return when are ready.[sic]",
    "Greetings!",
    "You're already on a quest for me, if I recall correctly. Have you talked to Oziach yet?",
    "Well, he's the only one who can grant you the right to wear rune platemail. He lives in a hut, by the cliffs west of Edgeville.",
    "Greetings!",
    "Oh? What did he tell you to do?",
    "The dragon of Crandor?",
    "Goodness, he hasn't given you an easy job, has he?",
    "Thirty years ago, Crandor was a thriving community with a great tradition of mages and adventurers. Many Crandorians even earned the right to be part of the Champions' Guild! One of their adventurers went too far, however. He descended into the volcano in the centre of Crandor and woke the dragon Elvarg. He must have fought valiantly against the dragon because they say that, to this day, she has a scar down her side, but the dragon still won the fight. She emerged and laid waste to the whole of Crandor with her fire breath! Some refugees managed to escape in fishing boats. They landed on the coast, north of Rimmington, and set up camp but the dragon followed them and burned the camp to the ground. Out of all of the people of Crandor there were only three survivors: a trio of wizards who used magic to escape. Their names were Thalzar, Lozar and Melzar.",
    "If you're serious about taking on Elvarg, first you'll need to get to Crandor. The island is surrounded by dangerous reefs, so you'll need a ship capable of getting through them and a map to show you the way. When you reach Crandor, you'll also need some kind of protection against the dragon's breath.",
    "Only one map exists that shows the route through the reefs of Crandor. The map was split into three pieces by Melzar, Thalzar and Lozar, the wizards who escaped form the dragon. Each of them took one piece.",
    "Melzar built a castle on the site of the Crandorian refugee camp, north of Rimmington. He's locked himself in there and no one's seen him for years. The inside of his castle is like a maze, and is populated by undead monsters. Maybe, if you could get all the way through the maze, you could find his piece of the map.",
    "Adventurers sometimes go in there to prove themselves, so I can give you this key to Melzar's Maze.",
    "Thalzar was the most paranoid of the three wizards. He hid his map piece and took the secret of its location to his grave. I don't think you'd be able to find out where it is by ordinary means. You'll need to talk to the Oracle on Ice Mountain.",
    "A few weeks ago, I'd have told you to speak to Lozar herself, in her house across the river from Lumbridge. Unfortunately, goblin raiders killed her and stole everything. One of the goblins from the Goblin Village probably has the map piece now.",
    "Even if you find the right route, only a ship made to the old crandorian design would be able to navigate through the reefs to the island. If there's still one in existence, it's probably in Port Sarim. Then, of course, you'll need to find a captain willing to sail to Crandor, and I'm not sure where you'd find one of them!",
    "That part shouldn't be too difficult, actually. I believe the Duke of Lumbridge has a special shield in his armoury that is enchanted against dragon's breath.",
    "Greetings!",
    "Greetings!",
    "Really? That's amazing! You are a true hero. There's no way that Oziach can refuse to sell you rune platemail now. You should tell him at once!"

    "You must be joking! Forget it.",

    "Uh... Hahaha.",

    "Well, did the stuff belong to you?",
    "Well, that would be why then.",
    "Sorry, thought this was a zoo.",
    "Can you help me get to Crandor Island?",
    "Yes, that's right. I've got to go there and kill the dragon for this quest I'm doing.",
    "Thanks, but I'll be fine!",
    "I'd rather go to Crandor Isle.",
    "Do you know when she will be seaworthy?",
    "Would you take me to Crandor when she's ready?",
    "Yes. Ha ha ha!",
    "No. I want to go to Crandor.",

    "It's the Lady Lumbridge, in Port Sarim.",
    "Yes, good point. I'd better go and fix her up.",
    "I fixed her up!",
    "Uh...yeah...about that. I don't actually have a map on me.",
    "The map's in the bank. I'll have to go and get it.",
    "Here you go.",
    "Will you take me to Crandor now, then?",
    "Uh...yeah...about that. I don't actually have a map on me.",

    "*Sigh* All right, I'll give ye a quest. I'll let ye wear my rune platemail if ye... Slay the dragon of Crandor!",
    "Hah, yes, you are a typical reckless adventurer, aren't you? Now go kill the dragon and get out of my face.",
    "Go talk to the Guildmaster in the Champions' Guild. He'll help ye out if yer so keen on doing a quest. I'm not going to be handholding any adventurers.",
    "Yes, I can understand that. Yer a coward.",

    "Back in my father's day, Crandor was an important city-state. Politically, it was as important as Falador or Varrock and its ships traded with every port. But, one day, when I was little, all contact was lost. The trading ships and the diplomatic envoys just stopped coming. I remember my father being very scared. He posted lookouts on the roof to warn if the dragon was approaching. All the city rulers worried that Elvarg would devastate the whole continent.",
    "That's a relief. I would hate to see such a promising adventurer cut down in [his/her] prime.",
    "If you really think you're up to it then perhaps you are the one who can kill this dragon.",

    "So, are you interested in buying a ship? Now, I'll be straight with you: She's not quite seaworthy right now, but give her a bit of work and she'll be the nippiest ship this side of Port Khazard.",
    "No, not really. Port Sarim's shipbuilders aren't very efficient so it could be quite a while.",
    "Crandor? You're joking, right?",
    "Crandor's not something we sailors joke about. You can't sail from here to Catherby, or Entrana, or Ardougne without going past that accursed island. You can't get to close to it because of the reefs, but you can always see it. Sometimes you can see a dark shape in the sky, circling the island. That's when you have to sail on as quick as you can and pray it's not hungry. Every year, more ships are lost to that dragon.",
    "Then you must be crazy. That island is surrounded by reefs that would rip this ship to shreds. Even if you found a map, you'd need an experienced captain to stand a chance of getting through and, even if I could get to it, there's no way I'm going any closer to that dragon than I have to. They say it can destroy whole ships with one bite.",
    "Oh, there was not particular accident. It's just years of wear and tear. The Lady Lumbridge is an old crandorian fishing ship - the last one of her kind, as far as I know. That kind of ship was always mightily manoeuvrable, but not too tough. She happened to be somewhere else when Crandor was destroyed, and she's had several owners since then. Not all of them have looked after her too well, but once she's patched up, she'll be good as new!",
    "Of course! I'm sure the work needed to do on it wouldn't be too expensive. How does 2,000 gold sound? I'll even throw in my cabin boy, Jenkins, for free! He'll swab the decks and splice the mainsails for you!",
    "Okey dokey, she's all yours!",

    "I dunno, it looks fine to me.",
    "Yes, but that was before you fixed it!",
    "Oh, I'll be fine. I've got work as Port Sarim's first lifeguard!",
    "Sure thing, she's all yours.",
    "Wow! You sure are lucky! Seems the Lady Lumbridge just washed right up into the dock by herself! She's pretty badly damaged, though ...",
    "No, it's not. It may, to the untrained eye, at first appear to be the Lady Lumbridge, but it is definitely not. It's my new ship. It just happens to look slightly similar, is all.",
