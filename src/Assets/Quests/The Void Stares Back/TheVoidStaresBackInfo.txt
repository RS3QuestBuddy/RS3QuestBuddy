Ravagers have the movement range of Scouts and the damage rate of a Knight, 
Shifters are less of a threat than other units and can be tanked if need be, 
Torchers are similar to Mages, 
Defilers are similar to Archers, 
Splatters will explode and deal 100 life points of damage to any adjacent unit that is within 1 square,
Win the game and proceed to the next room. GOOD LUCK!`
Sacrifice either Korasi or Jessika.`
Speak to Valluta before stocking for the fight or Sir Tiffy won't teleport you back.`
( READ AHEAD! ) Make all necessary preparations to fight the Pest Queen. Korasi's sword will be the primary weapon during the fight and its Special attacks will be used a lot. 
It may be helpful to use manual attack abilities rather than Revolution or 
you can use necromancy to trivialise the encounter. Summon conjures prior to equipping Korasi's sword, and keep your necromancy offhand equipped. Ghost will provide full sustain without food, and skeleton will do the majority of the damage now go
kill the Pest Queen... After you read these next couple steps`
The Weapon Special attack is located under Constitution abilities.`
If you die, talk to Sir Tiffy in Falador park and he will teleport you back to the portal. You will lose the weapon if you die. Reclaim this from Jessika/Korasi before you attack the Pest Queen again. (Chat 3)`
Build your adrenaline up more than 60% then use the special attack "Disrupt" to stun the Pest Queen when she raises her head and starts shaking for several seconds.`
Hurt but don't kill the spawning Elite defilers to defend Void Knight archers. They need to be focussed on you so more don't respawn and so they don't hurt your archers.`

Talk to Commodore Tyr.`
