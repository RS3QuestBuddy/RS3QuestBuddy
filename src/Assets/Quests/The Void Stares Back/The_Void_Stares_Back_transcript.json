    "Sorry, sir. Won't happen again.",
    "The label is at a funny angle, and it's not stuck down properly.",
    "Er, sir? We have a problem.",
    "Someone's switched the labels on these crates. When the knight thought he was putting in the pass number, he was actually putting in something totally different!",
    "How are we to do that? The labels are all mixed up.",
    "What were those things? Was that part of the security?",
    "I don't see any weight boxes in the room.",

    "Yes, sir.",
    "Err...I'd rather not. I've got a terrible rash, really unpleasant.",
    "Very well...",
    "Wait! You have to listen to me. I know it doesn't look good, but I'm on an important mission and all of our lives may be at stake.",
    "That was true in the past, but not this time. I'm not on a White Knight mission, I'm with the Void Knights. You have no history of adversity with them, so please hear me out.",
    "Appeal to his love of the Black Knights.",
    "The Pests are escaping from the Void Knight's Outpost. We don't really know how, but all the clues lead to here and to these cubes.",
    "Pests are a threat to all of us; they'll do anything to invade and destroy our world. I know you care deeply about the black Knights. Don't waste their lives because of your pride. Help us stop the pests.",
    "You're so quick to blame others, but it's you who has gotten us all into this mess! Making these cubes, abusing that pest to get the goo...all of this has led to pests escaping from the island and who knows what else? Now, (sic)",
    "someone has taken the cubes and opened a portal to gods know where! You want me to persuade you to help? Fine, help clean up your own mess! Take responsibility for your own actions and your foolish pride.",
    "This all started with me investigating an escaped pest from the Void Knights' Outpost. Along the way, I learned that a pest was used to create these cubes, and that you and the Black Knights were behind the whole thing. But",
    "now, I suspect that you were only part of that and someone was helping you, someone who had ulterior motives and has now betrayed you. That person poses a threat to all of us.",
    "As Sir Tiffy said, time is short! Use your head. Would the leader of the Temple Knights be asking for your help if there wasn't great danger to all?",
    "No one's bullying you, Daquarius. This is your own mess, and we're simply asking you to take responsibility for your actions. If you don't, then it's on your head what happens next.",
    "I'm not so sure. That seems quite dangerous and puts us all at risk.",
    "Hmm, I need to think on this.",

    "Hmm, that'd be a very powerful weapon indeed.",
    "Why would the Black Knights agree to fund making the cubes if he was going to use them on something else? They didn't seem to expect all of this.",
    "*I'm ready.",
    "Erm, they're coming this way...",
    "Back, you devils!",

    "I couldn't save Jessika, Tyr. I'm sorry.",
    "I refused to lie to someone about a matter affecting them closely, yes.",
    "You mean, I refused to kill a defeated opponent in cold blood.",
    "Of course I did. There seemed to be little need to kill unarmed slaves.",
    "It was the quickest way to end the workshop's production and stop the spread of the goo.",
    "I disagree with that. It was lost, crippled, confused, and out of the Pest Queen's control. It was no threat to anyone.",
    "I disagree with that.  The merciful thing for the pest was to put it out of its misery; the merciful thing for the people of this world was to remove a potential threat, however distant.",
    "There's no sense prolonging what has to be done.",
    "I have every faith in the Temple Knights.  They can rework him to be kinder, wiser and more constructive than before.",
    "He has been neutralised without being killed his death on top of all those others would be needless.",
    "I had some questions for you, if you don't mind.",
    "Who exactly are you?",
    "A job you performed less than admirably.",
    "To where Grayzag was opening his portals on the islands in the southern seas...",
    "Will there be a new queen in the Void?",
    "And will the new one keep up the attack?",
    "In the event that she doesn't need help, or if someone else helps her...",
    "It was Grayzag making the portals in the southern eas, so they'll stop appearing now, right?",

    "Great! Now, here's my plan. I'm going to give you some specially modified Black Knight armour. You're going to put it on and infiltrate the Black Knights' Fortress.",
    "Then try to find out anything you can about the cubes.",
    "Pretty much. The armour has been modified to follow your movements and listen in. That means Savant can track you and make sure you don't fall into any real danger.",

    "The blade is enchanted with powerful magics to combat the Void. I have a feeling you are going to need it to deal with the challenges we are going to face...",
    "Besides, I can use one of our regular maces instead. I'd be proud to see my sword lead us into battle.",
    "Jessika has kindly imbued it with a returning spell, so if you ever happen to lose the sword, it should return to me.",

    "Lord Daquarius, we have had our differences in the past. But long ago, all the knights of Falador banded together to protect our land. I would ask you to trust us that the threat of the Valluta is great enough that we",
    "must once again put aside our differences and form an alliance.",
    "I'll agree to that. [Player name] has proved himself to both Sir Amik and myself on many occasions.",
    "Not so fast, Grayzag! You're under arrest.",
    "Don't worry, Tyr's right on the other side. We'll get him. [Player name], you will have to deal with the Pest Queen. We'll send troops through as soon as they're ready.",
    "That's not the way. If Sir Amik were here he'd want to lock Grayzag away, that much I'm sure of.",
    "But I think the Temple Knights can gain information from him, then we'll dispose of him. He is too great a risk to keep around.",
    "I'm glad you feel that way, [player]. Rest assured, when we've gathered all we can, he will be dealt with.",

    "The Pest Queen! You'll be no match for me then. I'm glad you're here to witness the most awesome summoning act ever. Too bad you won't live to tell the tale.",
    "However, I need a little time yet to claim the Valluta's power for myself so...say hello to my little friends!",
    "That should be enough power for the portal. Now, for the catalyst. Ah, [player name]. So glad you could join us. You're just in time; I need your help.",
    "Oh, but you don't have a choice. You see, the cubes have drained the Valluta, and I used that power to open the portal, but I need a death to catalyse the summoning of the queen.",
    "I can kill Jessika, here, or I can order my pests to kill Korasi.",
    "I think it'll be more fun to let you decide.",
    "No, no, no. If you kill me, they both die and the Pest Queen will still be summoned. I'm growing tired of you stalling...",
    "Make. Your. Choice.",
    "And only the greatest summoner will be able to defeat her! And that's me!",
    "Only if you can catch me! WHEE!"

    "We wait, Daquarius. Savant will have us out of here in a jiffy.",

    "Capital idea, old spice.",
    "Come in, Savant; Cashien here.",

    "That's a good boy/girl. You can use my commorb to send your orders.",
    "Ah, welcome back old bean!",
    "Yes...that is odd. It must be that interference that Savant mentioned...",

    "Roger that, Tiffy! Reading you loud and clear!",
    "Copy that, Tiffy, I'll get you out. Just sit tight and try not to use your commorb much; transmitting on a high frequency like this will rapidly drain its power supply.",
    "Come in, Tiffy, Savant here.",
    "Tiffy, I can't get a lock on you, there's a lot of strange interference coming from near your location.",
    "The best I can do for now is send you a little something to help. You should be receiving it now...",
    "Savant here. How are things going, Tiffy?",
    "Good to hear. I'm reading power levels dropping in your commorb, though - best make this quick!",
    "I thought you might need backup, so I prepped a Conquest squad and have them ready to deploy to your location. I believe [player name] has experience commanding these troops, Tiffy.",

    "Try to anticipate what their actions will be while the commorb is recharging, and issue your orders accordingly!",

    "I couldn not draw myself back quickly enough when the attack came. Packed arounde with the leech goo, I was reduced to uselessness as you saw.",
    "Yes. There is always a queen.",
    "It was once that the queen, slave driver of pests, could not enter this world, for the weakening was too small.",
    "Now, I do not know. I suspect not, and that she would need help again, but Grayzag, twisted and insane, is taken away* and cannot help her.  *(The words 'taken away' are used when the player chooses to have Grayzag get taken to the Temple Knights.  They may be different if the player chooses to have the Void Knights kill Grayzag.)",
