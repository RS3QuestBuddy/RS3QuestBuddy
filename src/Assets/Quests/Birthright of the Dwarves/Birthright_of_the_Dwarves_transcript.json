  "King Veldaban": [
    "Hello, Player.",
    "Oh, don't call me that, Player. You of all people...",
    "What do you want to talk about?",
    "Meike altered the records. It only took a few pen-strokes, she said. It looks like I, and not Hreidmar, descended from King Alvis's secret heir. You, I and Meike are the only people who know it isn't legitimate. This must stay our secret, Player. I never wanted this kind of power, but it was the only way to keep Hreidmar off the throne.",
    "The old rules of succession included a maximum age. Once the king reaches a hundred and fifty, the throne passes on to their heir.",
    "The monarchy was for men only and everyone knows that. No one would have believed the records if they had pointed to Meike.",
    "The Consortium still exists. It's gone back to being an advisory body, just like it was in King Alvis's day. I don't like the Consortium's priorities, but they've got experience in running the city that I don't. I still need them around.",
    "It doesn't seem right. Maybe one day, but not anytime soon.",
    "What now? Everything now! Everything, right now! The Consortium had eight leaders - they could divide responsibility between them. I'm just one dwarf. I spend most of my time judging disputes. Company leaders squabbling over who owns how much of some mine or factory; workers trying to get better treatment out of the companies... I let the workers unionise, and now the company leaders hate me. The Consortium is meant to advise me but I have to second-guess everything they say. Those are just the domestic problems. I'm also trying to negotiate a permanent peace treaty with the local trolls, over the objections of half the Black Guard officers who think a war would be good for their careers. Not to mention that Guthix is apparently dead and the actual GODS are back in Gielinor. Most dwarves can pretend it's not happening, but a head of state doesn't have that luxury. Gah! Listen to me! I don't like what I'm turning into, Player.",
    "Oh, don't give me that. Do you know how many of the old kings of Keldagrim were the first-born sons of their predecessors? Maybe half. At first, the 'rightful' king was whichever warlord held onto the throne long enough to put his son on it after him. Later it was whichever nobleman murdered everyone above him in the line of succession. Our worst kings have been spoiled children who inherited the kingdom then taxed it to starvation in order to decorate their palaces. That's what Hreidmar would be like, and that's why Meike put me on the throne - to protect the kingdom from him and his like.",
    "Back when I was Keldagrim Black Guard Commander, I'd rant about the Consortium for not allocating me enough resources. Now I'm the one having to turn down Lieutenant Brae's requests for more funding. I have to make every decision myself because I can't trust my advisors. Dwarves - civilians - are going to die because of decisions I make, and eventually there'll be so many dead that I'll stop caring, and then who will I be? Being king will turn me into either a tyrant, or a puppet for the Consortium. The transformation is inevitable.",
    "I can't focus on the other problems until I've dealt with the real threat - the Red Axe! I haven't heard anything from them since we foiled Hreidmar's last plot. Whatever they're doing, they're being secretive about it. This time I'm not going to wait for them to strike! I'm the King of Keldagrim, with the entire Black Guard under my command, and a new alliance with the trolls. I'm going to attack their base before they have time to move! I could use your help, Player. You're the only person I know I can trust. Can I count on you?",
    "Right. There are three things I'd like you to do. Firstly, Lieutenant Brae has rounded up some suspected Red Axe spies. She's holding them in the records chamber in Keldagrim West. I'd like you to investigate and see if they're really spies. Secondly, I'd like you to go to Taverley Dungeon for me. There are chaos dwarves there, so the Red Axe must be up to something, and I want to know what. Kill those chaos dwarves and see if you can find any leads. Lastly, I want to have some defence against that ogre shaman's memory-altering magic. I know the Watchtower Wizard has experience with ogre shamans, so I'd like you to ask him for help. This seal will mark you as my agent.Veldaban gives you a royal dwarven seal.",
    "The suspects are in the records chamber, in the west wall of Keldagrim, next to the Black Guard HQ. Talk to Lieutenant Brae when you get there for more instructions. Remember: if they really are Red Axe spies, the penalty is death. Hreidmar and his cronies have killed Guthix-knows how many innocent dwarves. No one who's worked with them deserves mercy. If someone has committed treason but you can't link them to the Red Axe, there's a lesser punishment: exile. Get them far away so they can't damage Keldagrim. As my agent I'm empowering you to make the decision in each case.",
    "We both saw that the Red Axe creates chaos dwarves by transforming ordinary dwarves. Any chaos dwarves out there in the world, we've got to assume they're part of a Red Axe plot. Taverley Dungeon is dangerously close to human and dwarf lands. If the Red Axe is up to something there, I want to know what it is. Go there and kill some chaos dwarves. Keep an eye out for anything that happens and chase up any leads you see.",
    "I know the Red Axe have an ogre shaman working for them who can wipe people's memories. We've both been the subject of his spells. I hear the Watchtower Wizard once gave you a potion that let you kill ogre shamans. I want you to ask him for help against the Red Axe's pet ogre.",
    "Okay, bye.",
    "How are you getting on, Player?",
    "This seal will mark you as my agent.Veldaban gives you a royal dwarven seal.",
    "How are you getting on, Player?",
    "Thank you! I'll get a full report from Lieutenant Brae later, but I trust your judgement. I know you won't have let anyone live if they had a connection to the Red Axe.",
    "Interesting! They must have shed their old agents and gone deeper into hiding. This is a sign that they're planning something new and more dangerous. We must stop them quickly!",
    "How are you getting on, Player?",
    "Did you believe her?",
    "I wouldn't be so sure. She could be in league with the Red Axe, and trying to mislead us! We've got to move quickly!",
    "She could be in league with the Red Axe, and trying to mislead us! We've got to move quickly!",
    "How are you getting on, Player?",
    "Good work! I want you to keep hold of it - be prepared to use it on the ogre shaman when the time comes.",
    "It could? I didn't realise... No. It would be too painful, and I can't...I can't let anything distract me. Perhaps I'll use it when all this is over, but not now. I think we're ready. My army is assembling in the Barendir caves. I'll meet you there.",
    "What?",
    "How can you say that, after all we've seen? After all we've been through together? They kidnapped countless dwarves and transformed them into abominations. They tampered with both our memories. They blew up the Lava Flow Mine in order to overthrow the Consortium. Does Hreidmar seem like someone who would give up? While he still has a secret base, and an army of chaos dwarves? No, he's out there, and he's plotting something, I know it.",
    "How can I? How can I deal with problems properly while the Red Axe is still plotting to take over and no one believes they're a threat but me? Once we've defeated them, I'll focus on the other problems.",
    "I think we're ready. My army is assembling in the Barendir caves. I'll meet you there.",
    "Everything is ready! The Red Axe base is on the other side of that wall. I don't know what we'll find there, but we can be pretty certain there will be fighting. Speak to the quartermaster if you want anything from your bank. Once you're ready, you can have the honour of firing the cannon to breach the wall!",
    "It's up to us, Player! We've got to get to get [sic] past the lava flows, deal with those cannons, and raise the bridges so the army can advance!",
    "You think that makes it all right that you wiped the memories of hundreds of dwarves? That you wiped Hilda's memory?",
    "Finish him, Player! Then we can go after Hreidmar and Grimsson!",
    "You'd better not set foot in dwarven lands while I'm still king, ogre. Get out of my sight.",
    "Hreidmar and Grimsson were gone when I regained consciousness. They must have gone deeper into the Red Axe base. Let's go!",
    "Come on, Player! I bet Hreidmar and Grimsson are holed up in the top of the palace. We should find them!",
    "What?",
    "We'll make you the *only* Red Axe director in the palace. Come on, Player, let's kill some directors.",
    "There! Now the last Red Axe Director will make me a Red Axe member!",
    "Full of dwarves you'd kidnapped from Keldagrim East and turned into abominations! I don't care if you've given up - you still need to pay for your crimes!",
    "Player... I don't like...agh...what I'm...turning into.",
    "You've got to...kill me. Don't let me...turn into...that.",
    "We stopped Hreidmar. We...we won. Let...someone else...be king.",
    "Now I know what...what she went through. We'll be dead...chaos dwarves...together. Hilda...I remember you.",
    "I'm a bad king. I don't know what to do.",
    "Now I know what...what she went through. We'll be dead...chaos dwarves...together. Hilda...I remember you.",
    "Guthix damn you, Player. This is all your fault. You knocked that statue down...started this whole thing off. Hah. Hah hah hah. Hah hah hah hah hah hah haaah!",
    "What are you lot doing here?",
    "The question of continuing government?",
    "If this is a coup, it's a pretty poor one. The Black Guard is loyal to me.",
    "Player is right. Meike, I'm not cut out to be king. You put me on the throne to stop Hreidmar, and I've done that. It's time for me step aside. Ladies and gentlemen, the city's 'darkest days' are over. You 'band of petty councillors' can take it from here.",
    "You're right, I don't want to be king. But do you know who did want to be king? Hreidmar. I took the throne to protect the people of Keldagrim from Hreidmar, and I'll stay to protect them from the Consortium. I may not be a good king yet - but I'll learn. Now get out of my throne room.",
    "Hello again, Player.",
    "Now that the Red Axe is gone, I'm getting down to the serious task of being king. It's hard work but, like you said, I can learn.",
    "I'm learning to pick my battles and be realistic about how fast I can move. I'll get nowhere if I fight the Consortium, but I think I can work with them without compromising my principles.",
    "I'm not going to make Keldagrim into a better society overnight, and maybe not in my lifetime, but I can make steps in the right direction.",
    "I don't pretend to understand magic. I saw what happened to Grimsson and Hreidmar, and I could feel something happening to me, and I didn't want to end up like them.",
    "I could delay the change by concentrating. I thought I was dead, one way or another, but I wanted to hold on until you put me out of my misery. I didn't want to change.",
    "I was thinking, maybe this is best. I'd had my revenge on the Red Axe, and besides that revenge I had nothing left to live for. If this is the end, I thought, it was a good end.",
    "But then you didn't kill me, you stubborn human! I should have known you'd pay no attention to me.",
    "And then I saw the funny side. This whole thing started when I first met you, when you knocked down the statue and I made you rebuild it.",
    "I was king, but it was like I wasn't even the hero of my own story - it was always you! And at the end, there you were again, not even letting me have my heroic death.",
    "Maybe it's not really funny, but in that moment it seemed like the funniest thing in the world.",
    "And, I don't know, I think the realisation that you weren't going to kill me gave me the strength to fight off the transformation. I couldn't die, so I had no option but to live.",
    "Or maybe you just helped me for long enough for the magic to wear off. Either way, thanks, Player. You could easily have given me my wish, but you didn't.",
    "Yes...I suppose you could.",
    "You'd have to get another one from the Watchtower Wizard first, though.",
    "You know - I think I was using the Red Axe threat as a way to put off things I didn't want to think about, and this was one of them.",
    "It's an odd thing, knowing that a person once meant a lot to you, but barely being able to remember them.",
    "I have an image of what she was like, but I don't know how much of that is a memory and how much is my imagination. I'm scared that if I find out, I'll find I was wrong.",
    "You're right. Not knowing is an act of cowardice. All right, I'm ready.",
    "...",
    "Yes, yes, that's how she was.",
    "Thank you, Player.",
    "I think that's between me and Hilda's memory, Player. But thank you, you were right to restore my memory.",
    "Yeah, you're probably right."

  "Lieutenant Brae": [
    "Hello, human. Do you know when King Veldaban will be here to deal with these suspects? I can't hold them for much longer without charging them.",
    "I'm afraid you'll need to show me some proof of that, human.",
    "That is the King's seal. I was hoping he would come personally, but I suppose he has no time. You should investigate each of these suspects and tell me if you think they're a spy. King Veldaban has given you his seal, so you can pass judgement on them. Good luck.",
    "Vigr is a tradesman. His warhammer shop is in the north-west of the ground floor of Keldagrim Palace. We know he was a member of the Red Axe before the company left the city - that's not illegal. What we want to know is whether he's been in contact with them since. Klaas is a member of the Monarchist Society, but he's been publicly calling for people to rise up and overthrow King Veldaban. He says Veldaban isn't the rightful king. That in itself is treason, for which he could be exiled, but if he's doing it at the instigation of the Red Axe then he's an enemy agent and should be executed. We picked up Brendt and Grundt on Jatizso, where they were buying a shipment of ore from King Sorvott. They claim to be independent traders, but King Sorvott told us they mentioned the Red Axe. They also stayed on the island after their trade had been concluded, so it's possible they were spying for the Red Axe.",
    "Question each of the suspects, and then gather more information. If you find evidence, you can accuse them of being a Red Axe spy and then pass judgement.",
    "Really? Who?",
    "We investigated him, but he's clean. He's done business with all the mining companies, but he hasn't dealt with the Red Axe since they left the city.",
    "Baden, Glosur, Medwin and Obert? Yes, we investigated them, but they're not Red Axe agents any more - they left the Red Axe and became independent. King Veldaban decided to leave them alone.",
    "Is there anything else you need?",
    "You've found a contradiction in Brendt and Grundt's stories. It's up to you to pass judgement, Player. Firstly, what about Brendt? He told you a tale about 'Captain Redaxe', but Grundt didn't confirm it.",
    "Now, what about Grundt? He claims to have been carrying a red axe.",
    "It's not up to Meike, Player. You're the one who needs to pass judgement.",
    "Vigr has confessed to being a Red Axe spy, so it's up to you to pass judgement, Player.",
    "Thanks for dealing with the spies, Player. You should report back to King Veldaban.",
    "What can I do for you, Player?",
    "I am. I was having trouble with the responsibility at first, but the Supreme Commander says I've grown into the job.",
    "Thanks for your help with that, Player. At first I was annoyed that Veldaban would send a human to judge dwarves, but perhaps only an outsider could have judged them fairly.",
    "What do you want me to say? Is your conscience troubling you? Do you want me to tell you that you made the right choice?",
    "As the king's agent you were empowered to judge the prisoners however you saw fit. From a legal standpoint, whatever you did was correct.",
    "Decisions like that come with the territory, I'm afraid. No one said they were going to be easy.",
    "They're forbidden to enter lands controlled by Keldagrim. A lot of them seem to end up to the south of Yanille.",
    "A dwarf sentenced to death is taken to the mines outside the city and a Black Guard cuts off their head with an axe. It may not be a perfect system but at least it's quick.",

    "The captain of the Fremennik trading ship on which we arrived was nicknamed 'Captain Redaxe', due to his red, axe-shaped beard. You can see how King Sorvott might become confused.",

    "The poor little thing must have been so scared! I'm glad he was rescued and not eaten by a chaos dwarf.",
    "King Veldaban is still doing a great job. I just wish he'd have more parades and statues and things! Meike says he thinks they're a waste of money, but what's the point of monarchy without some pomp?",
    "It was so sad that King Veldaban died. He's a hero of the dwarven people! At least he'll always be remembered in the lists of the kings of Keldagrim.",
    "I loved the new king's coronation ceremony! I got commemorative beer stein with the king's face on it. It's my most prized possession!",
    "I'm sad that we don't have a king any more. Back to the boring old Consortium. Ah well...it was good while it lasted."

  "Pretty Flower": [
    "Yeah! We crush smelly chaos dwarves! Knock down chaos dwarf not-Keldagrim! That good fight!",
    "Hmm... We not at war for now, but me not sure we allies. Me not trust dwarves. King Veldaban, he warrior, me respect him, not like sneaky tradey dwarves.",
    "He still in charge for now, but me not trust other dwarves. Me keep eye on border, not let sneaky tradey dwarves in with sneaky poison.",
    "Me sad he dead. New king... me not like him. All he do is invite me to have drink. Me not fall for that! No one poison Pretty Flower that easy.",
    "Now sneaky tradey dwarves back in charge, me not know if things go so well. Me keep eye on border, not let sneaky tradey dwarves in with sneaky poison.",
    "It not easy. Me have to explain carefully to trolls. 'You not kill these dwarves, they friends, but you kill those dwarves, they bad.' Very complicated, make brain hurt. But when we get used to it, it fun! Each army work to own strengths. Friendly dwarves run around, use something called 'tactics'. Trolls go up to bad dwarves and hit them! Me like lady dwarf colonel! She have tiny dwarf lungs but she shout like troll!"

  "Colonel Grenda": [
    "Come on, you sons of trolls! D'you want to live forever?",
    "The Red Axe unleashed forces they couldn't control, human! This is what happens when you try to play Guthix! These chaos dwarves and dwogres have become a self-sustaining population. They're going to keep coming - all we can do is hold the line.",
    "I'm thinking of it as a training ground for Black Guards. Once you've been face to face with a screaming chaos dwarf waving a tube full of gunpowder, then you can call yourself a dwarven warrior.",
    "It was thanks to you, human! If you hadn't destroyed the cannons and raised the bridges, we'd never have gotten the army across.",
    "After that, the rest of the Red Axe didn't pose much of a challenge. Trolls aren't the brightest bunch, but I'll say this for them - if you point them at a locked door, that door won't last long.",
    "It's just a shame we got there too late and missed your fun with Hreidmar and Grimsson. I'd have liked to give them a taste of my axe!"

  "Dondakan the Dwarf": [
    "I suppose I should be proud of how incorruptible my son is...but would it kill him to use his royal powers to give his dad's business a helping hand?",
    ": Oh well...I suppose this rock is still providing a steady stream of income for me. After the company takes its cut, of course.",
    "So my son got to be king, and then stepped down! It's like I've always said - the current generation lacks ambition!",
    "His royal powers could have made us both so rich!",
    "I wish I'd spent more time with Veldaban when he was alive, rather than being obsessed with this rock. My only son, and I ignored him because he became a Black Guard rather than a miner.",
    "Since you helped me mine the rock, I've had all the riches I could want...but all the gold in the world won't bring my son back.",
    "Thanks."

    "Hahahaha! You won't believe it, matey! You won't...*hic*...believe it! I got so drunk...SO drunk...I thought my cousin was the king!",

    "Memory wand? You ain't got no memory wand. Maybe you *hic* forgot it. Hahahaha!",
    "My memory? What'sh wrong with my...what was it you said?",
    "Sounds like fun! Go ahead!",
    "...",
    "My goodness! So that was it! Not kebabs - chaos dwarves!",
    "The Red Axe were kidnapping dwarves and trying to turn them into chaos dwarves! But their process was faulty, and the test subjects all died. What a horrible sight!",
    "And their leader, Hreidmar, was carying a staff. A pink...dragon staff. Yes, that was it - a dragon staff, not a pink dragon!",
    "And there were gnomes! I saw gnomes and dwarves working together! The gnomes were carting off huge heaps of gold and valuable ores. It looks like they were trading their magical expertise for dwarven metals.",
    "Human, we must do something! The Red Axe experiments I saw all failed, but if they were to succeed, the Red Axe would have an army of chaos dwarves large enough to conquer Keldagrim!",
    "Come on, human! We must tell Commander Veldaban of the Black Guard!",
    "You did? Then this calls for a celebration! Let me get us something to drink...",
    "Wa-hey, matey! *hic* A toasht...a toasht to...whatever it was we were talking about."

    "Who?",

  "Grendt": [
    "Our predecessors. The Black Guard arrested them and took them back to Keldagrim.",
    "Yes. The Red Axe is outlawed, so the ore shipment that Brendt and Grundt were here to collect will be divided between the other mining companies. We're here to make sure it's delivered. Anything else Brendt and Grundt might have been doing, we know nothing about. They may have been spies or they may just have been traders."
