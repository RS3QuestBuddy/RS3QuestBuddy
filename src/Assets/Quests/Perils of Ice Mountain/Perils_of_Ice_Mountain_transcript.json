    "What alternative power station?",
    "It's making the monks' flowers die.",
    "Well, the monks do.",
    "It's making the icefiends extinct. It's so much hotter than before, so they're melting.",
    "But cows have always done that and there aren't any more volcanoes than before. Why is it getting hotter now?",
    "The Oracle predicted it would cause the end of civilisation!",
    "Yes! She talked about icebergs melting, Entrana being flooded and Varrock turning into a desert!",

    "I'll go and talk to Nurmof, then.",

    "What are you doing to those poor hatchling dragons?",
    "Nothing.",
    "You've got to shut down the power station!",

    "He did?",

    "I ask because an alternative power station would be kind of useful right now.",
    "Can't you tell me about it?",
    "So, what happened to these plans?",
    "We have to find the plans! The dragon power station will destroy the world, but Nurmof won't consider changing it without the plans.",
    "Is this your key?",
    "It was in Drorkar's pocket.",

  "Drorkar": [
    "Are you here with the last part of the delivery?",
    "About time. Now I can finally bring the station up to full capacity.",
    "Now, since you're here, I've got another job for you. Take this letter to Brother Bordiss in the Monastery, to the north-east of here.",
    "Oh, honestly. It's a quest, then. Deliver it and you'll get a Quest Point and a bunch of 'Letter-delivering' XP, or something. Now get going!",
    "If you see the delivery guy, tell him he'd better get here or he's out of a job. Now, what do you want?",
    "This, human, is the future. This generator provides power for the mine's machinery, all day, every day! It will dramatically increase industrial productivity and enhance the dwarven economy.",
    "It uses a turbine driven by the hot air from people asking stupid questions.",
    "Of course not, you idiot! But I'm hardly going to give industrial secrets to anyone who turns up. Now, leave me alone.",
    "Then don't ask stupid questions! This is cutting-edge dwarven technology and I'm not going to give away its secrets to anyone who turns up.",
    "At the moment, Nurmof's pickaxe machine. He was having trouble meeting demand, so he automated the construction process. His machine needed a power source and that's where we came in. That's just the start! As there are more pickaxes, there will be more metal being mined. This metal will need to be turned into products. So, there will be more machines and more power stations like this one to power them, and so on, towards a prosperous future!",
    "Oh, yes, a quest for a brave adventurer. I want you to fetch me the Helmet of the Dwarf Lords from the Mountains of Gold. Then I will reward you with a magic pickaxe. No, I don't have a quest! Do I look like some layabout who needs passing adventurers to do his work for him? Now, I've got work to do, so let me get to it.",
    "New resources for the power station.",
    "Oh, yes, like I'm going to give industrial details to anyone who walks in.",
    "I'm not sure yet. It depends what mood I'm in when I get back to Keldagrim and speak to his manager.",
    "Of course it was his fault! He should have been more careful.",
    "It's a privilege of being rich and powerful.",
    "Oh, honestly. Another bleeding-heart human 'hero' thinks [s]he can tell me what I can or can't do. Listen, dragons' stomachs are some of the most efficient heat production systems in the world. Normally, only adult dragons breathe fire, but if the young are force-fed coal then they can burn it more efficiently than any furnace.",
    "I don't have to justify myself to you! These dragons are the property of the Keldagrim Mining Consortium and we can do what we like with them. Concern over animal welfare cannot be allowed to hold back the glorious march of industrial progress!",
    "You again? What is it now?",
    "Really? Why is that, then?",
    "Bordiss? Pah! Bordiss is a failure. He's not fit to call himself a dwarf. He was too drunk and disorganised to finish his plans for an alternative power station. Now, he sits around all day with his little holier-than-thou club and thinks he can lecture ME?",
    "Oh, it was a crazy idea. It was clear it would never have worked. Forget I even mentioned it.",
    "Monks' flowers? Who cares about some stupid monks' flowers?",
    "Monks? Flowers? Pah! Things like natural beauty and spiritual fulfillment cannot be allowed to get in the way of industry! Ahem. I mean, naturally the death of the flowers is a bad thing but there is no conclusive evidence linking it to this power station.",
    "That's nothing to do with us. It's all due to cows breaking wind. Oh, and volcanoes.",
    "What I mean is, things that we dwarves or humans do can't possibly have an effect on the environment. The atmosphere and the ocean are endless reservoirs that can be dumped into without any repercussions! Now, leave me alone. I'm trying to increase the station's output.",
    "The Oracle?",
    "Oh, honestly. The idea that emissions from a station like this could affect the world's temperature are plain unfounded. These so-called 'oracles' are just out to make a quick gold piece out of your gullibility.",
    "-whereas, I'm paid by the people who designed this power station, so you know I'm impartial. I say that this power station can't possibly be the problem. Anyway, it's not my decision. If you want to shut us down so badly then talk to Nurmof. I'm sure he'll be delighted that you want to shut down the power source for his new pickaxe machine.",
    "You do that. You'll find him down inside the Dwarven Mine, right underneath this power station.",
    "Good! About time.",
    "Oh dear, oh dear! I suppose we'd better pull it down now because Brother Bordiss thinks we might be doing a bad thing.",
    "Don't be stupid!",
    "The wind power station will never work! Windmills are only good for grinding flour! Wind could never generate the power required.",

I didn't say it couldn't be done, I said it shouldn't be done! This power station will be a disaster for dwarves and everyone else.",

    "The night before I was meant to present the plans, Drorkar and I had some drinks together, but I drank too much. When I woke up the next morning, I had a terrible headache and I couldn't remember what happened the night before. I couldn't find the key to my chest anywhere! I was sure I had the key on me when I met Drorkar but, afterwards, it was gone. I asked Drorkar if he'd seen it but he just kind of smiled and said 'no'. My plans were in the chest and, without the key, I couldn't get at them. I was a failure as a dwarf. So, I came to the Monastery to atone. I vowed to never drink or speak again. Now, I've failed at that, as well.",
    "They're still within my chest in the Dwarven Mine, near Drogo's shop. But the chest is warded with magic - there's just no way to open it without the key.",
    "Saradomin be praised! That's the key! Where did you find it?",
    "Drorkar! Why, that-",
    "I ought to go over there and-",
    "I'm sorry, brother, but this changes everything. I'm not a failure. I didn't lose that key: Drorkar stole it! You've got to get those plans and give them to Nurmof. I'll pack my things - I'm going back to the Dwarven Mine!"

    "I am sorry for my brother's outburst. The path of the Saradominist monk is a demanding one and Brother Bordiss is one of our newest acolytes, so I am sure you will forgive him. Once my brother has achieved true peace and serenity he will never make similar- Great Saradomin!",
    "My roses! Look! They're dying!",

    "I don't understand it. The wind from Ice Mountain has always given us a nice cool climate. Recently, it seems to have been getting hotter, for some reason. Actually, it started getting hotter when Brother Bordiss joined us. Obviously, I don't think he's to blame!",
    "Could you? Thank you so much! If you applied some compost and then watered the roses, they would recover, at least for now.",

    "I still don't know. Bordiss was very secretive about his plans; he seemed to think that Drorkar or someone else would steal them. I do know that it wouldn't use fuel and wouldn't require any replacement parts from Keldagrim. That's sounding good to me now. The Consortium have doubled the price of dragon eggs, but I have to keep buying them.",
    "He didn't say. On the morning before the presentation he just left without a word. I eventually found he'd joined the Monastery, but when I went there he wouldn't talk to me. The monks said he'd taken a vow of silence. He seemed very upset, though.",
    "I can't shut it down! My business would be destroyed. Without this machine, I can't produce enough pickaxes to meet demand. Then the miners would start going to Keldagrim to buy the inferior pickaxes from Tati.",
