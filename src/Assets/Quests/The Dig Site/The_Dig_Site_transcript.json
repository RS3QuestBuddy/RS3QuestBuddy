    "Okay, next question... Earth Sciences level 1, question 3 - Health and safety. Can you tell me the proper safety points when working on a dig site?",
    "Okay, that covers the level 1 Earth Sciences exam. Let's see how you did...",
    "Deary me! This is appalling, none correct at all! I suggest you go and study properly.",
    "Why don't you use the resources here? There are the researchers, and you could even ask other students who are also studying for these exams.",
    "You got one question correct. Better luck next time.",
    "Do some more research. I'm sure other students could help you out.",
    "You got two questions correct. Not bad, just a little more revision needed.",
    "You got all the questions correct. Well done!",

    "Okay, next question... Earth Sciences level 2, question 2 - Handling of finds. What is the proper way to handle finds?",
    "Okay, next question... Earth Sciences level 2, question 3 - Rock pick usage. Can you tell me the proper use for a rock pick?",
    "Okay, that covers the level 2 Earth Sciences exam. Let me add up your total...",
    "No, no, no! This will not do. They are all wrong. Start again!",
    "More studying for you my [boy/girl].",

    "You got two questions correct. Not too bad, but you can do better...",
    "You got all the questions correct, well done!",
    "You have now passed the Earth Sciences level 2 intermediate exam. Here is your certificate. You also get a nice rock pick. Of course, you'll want to get studying for your next exam now!",

    "Ah, hello again.",

    "Okay, next question... Earth Sciences level 3, question 2 - Specimen brush use. What is the proper way to use a specimen brush?",
    "Okay, next question... Earth Sciences level 3, question 3 - Advanced techniques. Can you describe the technique for handling bones?",
    "Okay, that concludes the level 3 Earth Sciences exam. Let me add up the results...",
    "I cannot believe this! Absolutely none right at all. I doubt you did any research before you took this exam...",
    "You got one question correct. Try harder!",
    "You got two questions correct. A little more study and you will pass it.",

    "If you need something identified or are not sure about something, give it to Terry, the archaeological expert. He's standing over there outside the exam room.",
    "Of course! Let's see now... Trowels are vital for fine digging work, so you can be careful to not damage or disturb any artefacts. Rock picks are for splitting rocks or scraping away soil.",
    "Those are essential for carefully cleaning and storing smaller samples.",
    "Well, we've come into a bit more funding of late, so there should be a stock of each of them in the Exam Centre's tools cupboard. We also hand out relevant tools as students complete each level of their Earth Sciences exams.",

    "You can only use a site you have the appropriate exam level for.",
    "Really? What qualifications do you have?",
    "Well done! That means you can dig anywhere on this site, but you'll need to impress the examiner to use the winches.",
    "Good day; what can I do for you?",
    "I give permission... blah de blah... etc. Okay, that's all in order; you may use the mineshaft now. I'll hang onto this scroll, shall I?",

    "Hello, I am the panning guide. I'm here to teach you how to pan for gold.",
    "Let me explain how panning works. First you need a panning tray. Use the tray in the panning points in the water and then search your tray. If you find any gold, take it to the archaeological expert up in the museum storage facility. He will calculate its value for you."

    "Unusual... This object doesn't appear right... Hmmm... I wonder... Let me check my guide... Could it be? Surely not! From the markings on it, it seems to be a ceremonial ornament to a god named... Zaros? I haven't heard much about him before. This is a great discovery; we know very little of the ancient gods that people worshipped. There is some strange writing embossed upon it. It says: 'Zaros will return and wreak his vengeance upon Zamorak the betrayer.' I wonder what it means by that. Some silly superstition, probably. Still, I wonder what this is doing around here. I'll tell you what - seeing how you were the one to find this, I'll allow you to use the private dig shafts. You obviously have a keen eye. Take this letter and give it to one of the winch operators at the north end of the dig, and they will allow you to use them.",

It seems the followers of Saradomin have tried to cover up the evidence of this Zaros altar. This whole city must have been built over it! Thanks for your help; your sharp eyes have spotted what many have missed. Here, take this gold as your reward.",
