    "Hello I am Thormac the Sorcerer, I don't suppose you could be of assistance to me?",
    "I've lost my pet scorpions. They're lesser Kharid scorpions, a very rare breed. I left their cage door open, now I don't know where they've gone. There's three of them, and they're quick little beasties. They're all over Runescape.",
    "Well I have a scorpion cage here which you can use to catch them in.",
    "If you go up to the village of Seers, to the North of here, one of them will be able to tell you where the scorpions are now.",
    "Well I suppose I can aid you with my skills as a staff sorcerer. Most battlestaffs around here are a bit puny. I can beef them up for you a bit. If you go up to the village of Seers, to the North of here, one of them will be able to tell you where the scorpions are now.",
    "Blast, I suppose I'll have to find someone else then.",
    "How goes your quest?",
    "Ok, here's another cage. You're almost as bad at losing things as me.",
    "Well remember to go speak to the Seers, North of here, if you need any help.",
    "How goes your quest?",
    "Aha, my little scorpions home at last!",
    "Thank you for rescuing my scorpions."

  "Player": [
    "So how would I go about catching them then?",
    "Ok, I will do it then.",
    "What's in it for me?",
    "I've lost my cage.",
    "I've not caught all the scorpions yet.",
    "Your friend Thormac sent me to speak to you.",
    "He's lost his valuable lesser Kharid scorpions.",
    "That was cryptic. Can't you just tell me where it is?",
    "I need to locate some scorpions.",
    "I'm looking for some lesser Kharid scorpions. They belong to Thormac the sorcerer.",
    "So... do you know anywhere good to explore?",
    "Yes please!",
    "No, it's too dangerous for me too.",
    "Do I get a reward? For freeing you and all...",
    "Hi, I've retrieved the first scorpion.",
    "Any more scorpions?",
    "Oh come on now! Brown clothing? That's not a clue!",
    "Not really.",
    "Up a tree?",
    "I've heard you have a small scorpion in your possession.",
    "So where's this outpost?",
    "Thanks for the information.",
    "I have retrieved all your scorpions.",
    "That's okay.",
    "You said you'd enchant my battlestaff for me."

  "Seer": [
    "Uh, what was that dark force? I've never sensed anything like it... Anyway, sorry about that.",
    "Many greetings.",
    "What does the old fellow want?",
    "Well you have come to the right place. I am a master of animal detection. Let me look into my looking glass.",
    "I can see a scorpion that you seek. It resides in a dark place, between a lake and a holy island. There by the entrance shall you find it. So close and yet so far.",
    "Where would be the fun in that?",
    "Well you have come to the right place. I am a master of animal detection. Do you need to locate any particular scorpion? Scorpions are a creature somewhat in abundance.",
    "Let me look into my looking glass.",
    "Uh, what was that dark force? I've never sensed anything like it... Anyway, sorry about that.",
    "Well, I've checked my looking glass. The second Kharid Scorpion has been spirited away by a brute of a man. He runs a shop in a village two canoe trips from Lumbridge. That's all I can tell you about that scorpion.",
    "It's good that you should ask. I have information on the last scorpion for you. It seems to be in some sort of upstairs room. There's some brown clothing lying on a table nearby.",
    "Alright alright! The clothing is adorned with a golden four-pointed star. Happy now?",
    "Fine! You should go to where monks reside.",
    "MONKS! NOT MONKEYS!!!!"

  "Velrak the explorer": [
    "Thank you for rescuing me! It isn't very comfy in this cell.",
    "Well, this dungeon was quite good to explore ...until I got captured, anyway. I was given a key to an inner part of this dungeon by a mysterious cloaked stranger! It's rather tough for me to get that far into the dungeon however... I just keep getting captured! Would you like to give it a go?",
    "Well... not really... The Black Knights took all of my stuff before throwing me in here to rot!"
  ],
  "Peksa": [
    "Are you interested in buying or selling a helmet?",
    "Now, how could you know about that, I wonder. Mind you, I don't have it anymore. I gave it as a present to my brother Ivor when I visited our outpost in the west. Well, actually I hid it in his room so it would nip him. It was a bit of a surprise gift.",
    "It's a fair old trek to the west, across the White Wolf Mountains. Then head west, north-west until you see the axes and horned helmets.",
    "No problem! Tell Ivor I said hi!"
