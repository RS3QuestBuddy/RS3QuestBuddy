    "Watch yourself, World Guardian. More TzekHaar might come through that gate at any moment.",
    "I arrived here just in time to see a horde of them break through to the surface. I dealt with them, but I wonder what happened to your defenders.",
    "Looks like your allies need our help to finish this war.",
    "Of course I do.",
    "Zamorak may have decided that his strength is better used elsewhere but I do not agree.",
    "The fight below is one for the fate of Gielinor. I don't want to see your alliance lose, and I don't reckon much of your odds without us.",
    "So I left my armour behind and came here to see what I could do.",
    "Our new friend here had the same idea.",
    "A pity. Nevertheless, we need to clear the enemy out so we reach the cathedral.",
    "If you had any sense you wouldn't trust me. I certainly wouldn't, if I were wearing your shoes.",
    "But considering that the TzekHaar are breaching the surface, I'd say you have little choice.",
    "You need all the help you can get and we have a common enemy. Trust doesn't need to come into it.",
    "I intend to reach the cathedral, World Guardian. Help me, or get out of my way.",
    "Go into the city and kill any TzekHaar you find. I will hold the surface entrance and stop any escaping. We'll meet at the cathedral when you are done.",
    "It's all right, Princess, your daddy doesn't scare me.",
    "His pride was wounded, yes, and no wonder. He sacrificed his freedom and strength to help you, of all people, and look how you repaid him.",
    "Nothing but insults and suspicion. No wonder he grew tired of you. In the face of such disrespect, I would do the same.",
    "That being said, it was his pride - not mine - and I am not his mirror.",
    "This world still needs saving. He might think he can jolt you into stepping up to fix this mess, but I am not willing to leave it to chance.",
    "Gielinor is my home as much as it is yours. I'm here to make sure it survives - with you, or despite you.",
    "Very sensible of you.",
    "Disbelieve me all you want. It makes no difference to me.",
    "I'll do what I must to make sure Gielinor endures. We all have a better chance of survival if we work together.",
    "Consider it done.",
    "The nerve of those two. 'Stay back and defend the doors, witch.'",
    "As if they weren't fighting for their lives.",
    "Do you have a plan for when we find them, World Guardian?",
    "If she can't do it, then the eggs will need to be destroyed.",
    "I'm sure she can be persuaded.",
    "I didn't realise your World Guardian powers stretched that far.",
    "We need something more solid than that.",
    "About time. They've caused more trouble than they're worth.",
    "What if she's not? A god of her power could be anywhere, on any world.",
    "Keep it together. We have a chance but only if we don't lose our focus.",
    "We should split up. I can search Gielinor. Teleporting is easy for me - I can cover more ground that way.",
    "The fate of the universe is more important than any of our personal quarrels. I will not be foolish enough to stab your allies in the back, given the circumstances.",
    "That's the spirit, Princess.",
    "Without a strategy, you'll never find her in time. Do you have any way of narrowing your options?",
    "comm",
    "Drop something so I can give it to you.",
    "A way of contacting me if you need it. Activate it and I will answer.",
    "If we find Seren, we will let you know, and we'll keep her occupied until you join us.",
    "And you are Kerapac's son.",
    "I've heard a lot about him.",
    "Ah, World Guardian. Well?",
    "So where do we look first?",
    "I'm beginning to like you.",
    "Enough chatter. Is Seren here?",
    "I'm surprised to see you getting your hands dirty, Princess. Don't you have servants for that sort of thing?",
    "Hrm... I can respect that.",
    "Well, that was a bust. I really thought she'd have gone to Tarddiad for her precious elves. Where else could she be?",
    "Why would she go to the world your father helped to destroy?",
    "Your father really did a number on this place, Princess. No intelligent creature left alive, as far as the eye can see.",
    "But your father led them here. He has a habit of bringing war and destruction wherever he goes, yet he still calls Zamorak the villain.",
    "...",
    "Do you hate him? Kerapac?",
    "He's one of the most powerful beings in existence right now. A dragonkin armed with two elder artefacts: the Needle and the Siphon.",
    "Actually three, though he seems to ignore the Mirror for some reason. If you were on better terms you could leverage that power.",
    "A dog can always get free of its leash.",
    "Well that's romantic nonsense. He's dead, long dead, and he hasn't been on Naragun for aeons. She'd have had more memories of him on Gielinor than here.",
    "Maybe another time. Everyone RUN!",
    "That's two wrong. What now?",
    "Another dead end.",
    "No need. I can take us to the mountain above the Halls directly.",
    "This isn't the first time I've visited my father's homeworld. Come. Are you all ready?",
    "Onwards, then.",
    "They don't get deader than this.",
    "Something above.",
    "By the Abyss...",
    "That's not possible. The Shadow Breach is closed. It's in the Monolith, on Gielinor. Azzanadra closed it months ago.",
    "You said it knew we were here. Is it alive?",
    "You didn't give us much time, did you?",
    "You don't?",
    "Well. That's not something you see every day.",
    "Erebus didn't tear you apart. How are you feeling?",
    "You helped defeat an Elder God, World Guardian. That is...something.",
    "Quite staggeringly blasphemous to some eyes, I'm sure, but as Zamorak's agent, I commend your efforts.",
    "We should go back to halls[sic]. We can't let Seren get away again.",
    "We just saved all your skins.",
    "Don't be so humble, World Guardian. It's not every day that you vanquish an Elder God.",
    "Let us take some of the power, then. One final bloodletting.",
    "Don't be ridiculous.",
    "She's stalling.",
    "She means to hatch them here!",
    "Cut the self-pity. You can feel bad once we've fixed this.",
    "Who decided that? On whose command, exactly, do you lie down and die without a fight?",
    "Don't bother. You cannot save those who do not wish to be saved.",
    "If they won't help themselves, they're a lost cause.",
    "Feel free to stay behind and waste time trying to change their minds. See where it gets you.",
    "We shouldn't be helping them. If they want to live, they should get up and fight for it.",
    "The sooner we're off this rock, the better.",
    "And the eggs?",
    "Good luck.",
    "Zamorak will be delighted to hear of your death, World Guardian.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "There was nothing I could do, Adrasteia. I'm sorry. I had to leave them...",
    "...",
    "Careful, World Guardian.",
    "And then what?",
    "Not that it matters. You wormed your way out of it, as usual.",
    "Has your father told you what this World Guardian is for? Do you know what it means?",
    "If a god wants Gielinor, they must first get through its World Guardian.",
    "But there lies a conundrum, because a World Guardian can't be hurt by gods. Its creator made sure of that.",
    "The greatest prize in this universe, the one perfect world, protected by the only creature that immortal hands can't kill.",
    "What's a god to do?",
    "No. Oddly enough, the fate of the universe struck me as more important than the removal of this particular thorn in our side.",
    "But the opportunity was too good to waste.",
    "Ask your father. He would have done the exact same thing.",
    "You think you can take me?",
    "And perhaps one of you would survive.",
    "Don't be stupid, Adrasteia. I don't want to kill you.",
    "Someday soon, my lord will return, and he will take this world for himself.",
    "I want you to face that, Princess. You've spent so long in your shining towers above the clouds of Hallow. I wonder what you know of cruelty. Of war.",
    "I want to see what it does to you. I want to see what you become."

  "Player": [
    "Moia? What are you doing here?",
    "And what do you mean, more TzekHaar?",
    "You do know that Zamorak abandoned the cathedral alliance, right?",
    "Then what are you doing here?",
    "You're trying to reach the cathedral too?",
    "Hold on. How can I trust you?",
    "Fine. If the defences are failing then I need to go there anyway.",
    "I shouldn't open the door with the TzekHaar out here.",
    "That's all of them. I should go to the cathedral and find out what happened to the defenders.",
    "Now is not the time for that.",
    "I've faced worse.",
    "What's going on? Why are the doors shut?",
    "It seems I got here just in time.",
    "Daughter?",
    "Yes, she's on our side.",
    "She's only here to sabotage us.",
    "Why are the fronts so close? What happened?",
    "How are the eggs?",
    "Seren? How soon are they going to hatch?",
    "What's wrong?",
    "Where's Azzanadra? Can't he help?",
    "We need to get the fronts under control.",
    "I'll help him.",
    "You're Saradomin's daughter?",
    "What do you know about the battle?",
    "I'll see what I can do.",
    "Ugh. Thanks for getting me out.",
    "I'm going back in. I won't stop until we clear all of that mutated fungus.",
    "I'll see what I can do.",
    "You're alone out here? What happened to the mages?",
    "What do you need me to do?",
    "Is it still functioning?",
    "I'll give it a go. I'll destroy them much faster if I use it.",
    "Begone, foul beast!",
    "FIRE!",
    "Take that!",
    "You can't stop me!",
    "You're too late, Kerapac. I've already destroyed your siege engines.",
    "Your army has gone.",
    "What?",
    "If you think I'm going to stop destroying your engines, you're sorely mistaken.",
    "It's Zuk! He's coming for the eggs!",
    "Seren!",
    "Seren took the eggs and teleported away somewhere. We need to find her before the Elders do.",
    "Out here there's nothing stopping the Elders from touching the eggs and hatching them, and if that happens...",
    "We'll get Seren to keep the eggs dormant.",
    "We'll build something to keep the Elders at bay.",
    "I mean...we could work something out.",
    "We'll destroy the eggs.",
    "We have to find them first.",
    "She might still be on Gielinor.",
    "Are you sure that's a good idea?",
    "I will go to the World Gate and start looking on other worlds.",
    "Not really.",
    "That's right.",
    "What does Vicendithas know about anima?",
    "That sounds promising. We should talk to him before starting our search.",
    "You two start at the Elder Halls. Seren may have taken the eggs back there.",
    "What's this?",
    "All right. I'll go talk to Vicendithas.",
    "I shouldn't use this until I've finished speaking to Vicendithas.",
    "Hannibus told me that you're building an anima diviner.",
    "Seren has taken the Elder God eggs from Senntisten. We need to find her before the Elders reach them and destroy the universe.",
    "If you have any way to search for the eggs, it would help us.",
    "What exactly is it that you're working on?",
    "Like the Measure does?",
    "You've met Charos?",
    "Not any more, he's not.",
    "You mean his crown, right? The one that Zaros took when he left for Erebus?",
    "Does your device not do that?",
    "Would it help if I gave you the Measure?",
    "It was. I lost it.",
    "It is!",
    "Mr Mordaut, I lost the Measure!",
    "Hannibus said I left it here on Anachronia and your were keeping it safe for me?",
    "I have the Measure!",
    "Have you been helping Vicendithas with his research?",
    "What do you mean?",
    "The other gods stayed to contain the fighting. They are stopping it from spreading to the surface.",
    "Not permanently.",
    "Not yet.",
    "Have you two had a fight?",
    "Why are you helping the Ilujanka?",
    "Can you use it? Can you find the eggs?",
    "So she took them off-world.",
    "I appear to have lost the Communication Device.",
    "Moia? Are you there?",
    "We found Vicendithas. He's done some experiments and we found that the eggs aren't on Gielinor anymore. Seren's taken them somewhere else.",
    "Can you meet me at the World Gate? I'm heading there now.",
    "I should tell Hannibus and Vicendithas that we're going to the World Gate.",
    "I've already talked to Moia.",
    "I'm going to the World Gate.",
    "Can you remind me where the World Gate is?",
    "Thanks.",
    "I hope we're not too late.",
    "Seren and the eggs aren't on Gielinor. This is Vicendithas - he has a device that can pick up the eggs' anima signature.",
    "But they're not here.",
    "We should try Tarddiad first. There's lots of life there, and it's where Seren first met the elves.",
    "There's a personal connection - it would be the first place she thinks of. She might think to hide there to keep the eggs safe.",
    "Like the crystals in Prifddinas? They've absorbed some of Seren's essence?",
    "What does that mean?",
    "I've already investigated here. I should look somewhere else.",
    "We're looking for Seren. We thought she might have come here.",
    "But you'd been to Gielinor and seen her there?",
    "Kerapac! Everyone, get ready to fight!",
    "You'll die too!",
    "It's worth a look.",
    "We'll have to be ready to run if he does.",
    "She's not here. We should head back to the World Gate and try somewhere else.",
    "But if it was?",
    "Do you mean somewhere like Kethsi? Where the Stone of Jas was kept?",
    "Worth a shot. Let's try Kethsi.",
    "And if Kerapac finds us there...maybe I can try to get through to him.",
    "There must be something I can do to help him turn against Jas.",
    "That's all we need, Kerapac. Time.",
    "You don't want this. You want none of this. If you could, you would help us, wouldn't you? Help us stop Jas?",
    "Are you so easily humbled that you would choose to blindly obey Jas? Don't you have any strength of your own to fight against her?",
    "A moment is all we might need.",
    "You mentioned that Jas herself is coming. That she follows behind you, right?",
    "I'm not looking to fight her. We just need you to delay her until we can find out a way to stop this. You can be a part of stopping her, without having to actively defy her.",
    "To spite her? To be one step closer to stopping her? At the very least we need to find Seren before there's any reason to follow us. We don't have the eggs after all.",
    "But with just a little more time, we might be able to find a way out of all of this. Help us.",
    "Because you're not her slave? Isn't that enough? You hate me, I don't blame you, but don't you hate her more?",
    "Then work with us. Defy her. With just a little more time, we might be able to find a way out of all of this.",
    "Thank you.",
    "It's better than nothing.",
    "Freneskae? It has a personal connection to Seren as well, it was her home for thousands of years.",
    "Freneskae. A dead world. Why would Seren bring them here?",
    "Vicendithas, can you tell where she is?",
    "It's quite a climb, but the old Elder Halls aren't far from here. From there we can plan our search.",
    "You can?",
    "This is where the last generation of Elder Gods hatched. They bled the planet dry of anima, and then they moved on to the rest of the universe.",
    "This is what will happen to any world the eggs hatch on.",
    "Follow me and climb down this ledge. The Halls are this way, in the heart of the mountain.",
    "Follow me. The halls are this way.",
    "We're not going anywhere.",
    "What were you thinking? The gods were about to end this for good. Why did you run?",
    "What was that?",
    "In the cradle?",
    "Come on. Let's go see.",
    "It feels like-",
    "Shut up!",
    "Right. Sure.",
    "I saw a portal.",
    "What's this got to do with Zaros? What do you know?",
    "What is it?",
    "Horrors within?",
    "Erebus.",
    "Someone who might be able to help us. Stay here. We'll go talk to him.",
    "Adrasteia and Hannibus - you stay here. Make sure nothing happens to Seren. Moia, Vicendithas - brace yourselves. This could get a little painful.",
    "Below, in the Elder Halls. The eggs are with her.",
    "No.",
    "Uh...",
    "We will send her through the portal.",
    "We need to keep her trapped here in a time loop.",
    "We should attack her with the Needle.",
    "What just happened?",
    "We can't attack her, can we?",
    "In this universe?",
    "Oh.",
    "No. It's not.",
    "I don't know.",
    "But I think I'm the only one who can stop her.",
    "It's choking me. I can't breathe.",
    "Not yet. Something in there is slowing me down - I can barely move.",
    "I made some progress. There are rifts in there, and they can take me between islands.",
    "Some won't open for me, though.",
    "There are souls in there!",
    "You were right - I can use the souls. I found one that helped me move a boulder.",
    "I found a different type of soul.",
    "I activated a lodestone in there. I think this is a fragment of it.",
    "It's a memory, I think. Like a wisp.",
    "I could use the memory to explore more - it activated some sort of fissure.",
    "You pulled me out before I could use it, though.",
    "My legs feel lighter.",
    "Hear what?",
    "It feels like a huge weight has lifted.",
    "What is it?",
    "It's a structure of some kind. An idol, maybe?",
    "Something big is coming! Everyone get down!",
    "I should hang on to these.",
    "...",
    "Didn't you vanish with her?",
    "But you're lost too.",
    "I'm fine, I think.",
    "Thanks, I think.",
    "Jas came for the eggs. Kerapac and I used the Needle to banish her through the portal.",
    "Turns out there are things in Erebus strong enough to overpower her.",
    "It doesn't matter. We're safe now.",
    "He sacrificed himself and the Needle to make sure the plan worked. The shadow monster took him too.",
    "The Needle broke, though. I used it to survive in Erebus and it shattered.",
    "I did what was needed. Jas was here to kill us all and take the eggs. Now we have one less Elder to worry about.",
    "This has gone on long enough, Seren. We need to decide what to do with the eggs.",
    "We need them to hatch here. It's a dead world. It's the only place they won't kill anything - there's nothing for them to destroy.",
    "We've wasted enough time. The eggs need to be destroyed.",
    "We need to keep them unhatched. Seren - can you keep draining their anima?",
    "Where is she going? Get after her!",
    "Seren! What are you doing?",
    "That's not what this is!",
    "But -",
    "How do we get off-world?",
    "We need to start the evacuation. What do we need to do?",
    "You're not going to try to stop it?",
    "Will there be others who want to evacuate?",
    "So we evacuate those who want to go. Start here.",
    "Moia - get the world gate open back to Gielinor. Adrasteia, get the word out to anyone who wants to leave.",
    "I'll start helping anyone who needs to get through the gate.",
    "Do you need help evacuating?",
    "I'm afraid so.",
    "Can't you make more on Gielinor?",
    "I've not found any tools yet.",
    "I've got some tools here for you.",
    "Here you go.",
    "Are you going to leave?",
    "Do you need me to help carry anything?",
    "You should get to the Word Gate, then.",
    "What about your stories?",
    "Of course.",
    "Something wrong?",
    "I lost he seed bag.",
    "I've not found any seeds yet.",
    "I've found some seeds!",
    "Here are the seeds.",
    "So...will you leave?",
    "What do you need?",
    "Your fish? Are they important?",
    "I lost the bucket.",
    "I lost the net.",
    "I've not found any fish yet.",
    "I've found some fish!",
    "Here you go. One bucket of fish.",
    "I shouldn't take those yet.",
    "I need a seed bag to carry those seeds. Maybe the Plantkeeper has another one?",
    "I've filled the bag with seeds. I should give it back to the Plantkeeper.",
    "I've already taken the seeds from this plant.",
    "I've already filled the bag with seeds. I should give it back to the Plantkeeper.",
    "I've collected all the seeds I need here. I should see if anyone else needs help evacuating.",
    "I don't know whose that is - I should leave it alone.",
    "I don't have enough space to pick that up.",
    "I should leave those alone for now.",
    "I need a bucket to put those fish in. Maybe the Pondkeeper has another one.",
    "I need a special net to catch those fish. Maybe the Pondkeeper has another one.",
    "That looks like all the fish I neeed[sic]. I should give them to the Pondkeeper.",
    "I've got all the fish I need. I should give them to the Pondkeeper.",
    "Everyone who wanted to leave this village is gone.",
    "I should go to the World Gate see[sic] how the rest of the evacuation is going.",
    "Everyone who wanted to leave from this village has gone. We should get to the next one.",
    "It's Seren. I'll go see what she's doing.",
    "What are you doing?",
    "But we're not done evacuating! We need more time!",
    "Please, Seren. You could stop all of this.",
    "We're out of time. I should tell the others before it's too late.",
    "We're out of time. You need to get everyone out.",
    "Don't wait for me. I'll distract her while you finish the evacuation.",
    "I can't stop her. Nothing can, now. But I can delay her.",
    "I can distract her from her song. That should slow the Elders.",
    "What are these?",
    "If you won't delay this, I will.",
    "Never.",
    "As long as I live, I'll buy the others time for the evacuation.",
    "I'm on my way!",
    "What?",
    "No!",
    "It's not working!",
    "Why isn't it working?",
    "Seren? Where are we? Am I...dead?",
    "I...",
    "No. Do you?",
    "So it's not...Sliske?",
    "What about the rest of us? It's only a matter of time before they grow hungry. Then they'll start eating other planets.",
    "You've doomed us all...",
    "You will keep them here on Iaia?",
    "This is...acceptable. If you keep them safe here, then the rest of the universe will be spared.",
    "I can't trust you. How can I be sure you won't let them escape?",
    "You left me for dead.",
    "You lying piece of-!",
    "You saw me running for the portal! There was time!",
    "But you closed it and left me behind!",
    "You could have waited. Just a few more seconds and I would have made it.",
    "So you thought to kill me for him.",
    "It's gone. I'm so sorry.",
    "The eggs hatched. Seren and I survived.",
    "The power from Erebus protected me, and...I think they recognised Seren.",
    "She's chosen to stay with the hatchlings. She promised me that she would keep them safe - that she would never let them leave.",
    "The universe is set against them, she said, and they need to stay with her to keep safe. Forever.",
    "We should go back to the Cathedral and tell the others. Vicendithas, Hannibus...",
    "I was going to ask the same of you. Where is everyone?",
    "Kerapac is gone. He sacrificed himself to help us deal with Jas.",
    "The eggs hatched on Iaia.",
    "It was not for nothing.",
    "Wen, Bik, and Ful have hatched their eggs, yes. And Iaia is gone, yes.",
    "But Seren and I witnessed the destruction of Iaia and survived it, and she swore to me that she would remain with them.",
    "Jas and Kerapac followed us to Freneskae. Kerapac betrayed her and helped me banish her to Erebus.",
    "We tried to make Seren hatch the eggs on Freneskae, but she refused, and instead took them to Iaia.",
    "They won't. Seren is convinced the universe is too dangerous for them.",
    "There are too many gods who want them dead, too many forces who would do them harm. So she's going to keep them forever on Iaia, and raise them as her own.",
    "But I didn't save Iaia.",
    "She did, for a while.",
    "Then she betrayed us and left me for dead on Iaia when the Elders arrived. She left to rejoin Zamorak.",
    "Now what will you do?",
    "Fresh air?",
    "You played your part too. If it weren't for your plan to bring the eggs to Senntisten, and your battle with the Arch-Glacor, we would have been finished months ago.",
    "Alone? None of us were alone.",
    "Could it be because you've ascended?",

    "It is how you survived Erebus, after all. A mortal soul could never withstand walking on its shores as you did.",
    "But you withstood it, taking in its power...becoming stronger.",
    "So when the children tasted it, they recoiled. So you were spared, as they spared me.",
    "Your gift. Guthix's protection. Is it...gone?",
    "Who is that? Those...voices? I recognise them...",
    "How curious. Do you know what they are?",

    "No. Not him. They are something else. Something more.",

    "Oh, these poor newborns. Forced into existence on the wrong world.",
    "Gielinor was destined to be their home. Born there, they would have had the strength to strike out into the universe.",
    "Here though...Iaia was enough for them to hatch, but beyond that...they are weak.",
    "And now I know what threats lie in the darkness of the universe. Shadow beasts, capable of destroying the strongest of my kind.",

    "I ought to thank you. You've shown me how dangerous this universe can be.",
    "I can't let them leave this planet, not when the dangers of Erebus lie so close.",
    "No. I won't allow it. They have to stay here. It's the only way I can keep them safe.",
    "I must. This universe wants my children dead. I have to protect them.",
    "Is this acceptable to you, World Guardian? Or will you have them killed, like Jas?",
    "Escape? Why should they want to escape? I will raise them as my own. They are lost, and weak, and frightened. They need me, and always will.",

    "Vindicta showed me the map. We can go there when we're ready.",
    "There aren't many settlements on Iaia, and they're in walking distance, but we should hurry anyway.",
    "What's that?",
    "How?",
    "Be strong, World Guardian.",

    "Player! You're alive!",

    "How could you? After everything they did - they saved us all!",
    "He would never do such a thing! You will answer for this.",
    "Oh, I should have seen that coming. How could she? That - that -",
    "We saved as many as we could.",
    "What about Seren? If the eggs hatched... How long until they reach the next world?",
    "She's...not going to let them leave Iaia?",
    "And she gets her family, at last, and forever.",
    "We saved as many as we could. Some chose to stay behind, though.",
    "And we couldn't stop Seren...",
    "You defended the Cathedral for as long as you could. You saved us from Jas. You fought Seren until Iaia's evacuation was complete.",
    "None of us would be alive if not for you.",

    "Now what do we do?",
    "We're all doomed.",
    "Could she do that, on her own? Didn't she need the help of three other gods to manage it in Senntisten?",
    "I'm not certain she would allow that.",
    "Even if we find a way to do that - and I doubt there is one - I fear you would have to get past Seren first.",
    "Indeed.",
    "And there are hundreds of worlds she could have gone to!",
    "I believe I may know something that can help. The eggs are anima sources, correct? Like the Stone of Jas?",
    "Before I left Anachronia to join the fight, I heard that Vicendithas was working on something to do with anima. A collaboration with Charos, I believe.",
    "He believes it might be the key in his quest to help my people, the Ilujanka, survive. He said he needed a diviner...something to measure the anima of a world. If he was successful, it might help us find the eggs.",
    "Forgive my ignorance, but the Locator is...?",
    "You left it behind on Anachronia, Player. Mr Mordaut has been safekeeping it for you.",
    "I have attempted to, yes. The matter of my people's survival is something dear to me.",
    "When I heard that Vicendithas was continuing his father's work trying to save us...I thought my experience would help.",
    "Instead, I found myself merely intruding.",
    "I knew Kerapac, if only briefly. I had some insight into his work. I, ah, misjudged my approach, though. There are depths of feeling at play I had not anticipated. I thought-",
    "My apologies.",
    "Kerapac is not acting of his own will. You cannot blame him for this.",
    "That is true, but-",
    "It's nothing. I offered my concern, and it was not welcomed. Quite understandable, really. Like he said - his family is not my business.",
    "Let's not speak of it here.",
    "You should contact Moia with that device and let her know what we've found.",
    "Don't worry, I picked it up.",
    "However, you don't appear to have space in your inventory.",
    "You should use it to contact the others.",
    "You should use Moia's communication device to contact the others.",
    "I'll help too. I will meet you there.",
    "We should go to the World Gate to meet the others.",
    "So this is the world of the elves? The colours remind me of my own home, Iaia. Vibrant and full of wonder.",
    "Must you be so cold?",
    "Regardless, this world is magnificent to behold.",
    "Have you tried speaking with him yet?",
    "He's your father! I only just recently learned that I have a child, a fully grown daughter. I've known her barely any time at all, yet she is already the most important thing in my world.",
    "Your father must feel the same, deep down.",
    "Kerapac, please! You can't want the Elder Gods to hatch and destroy us all.",
    "What about Kerapac? What if he finds us again?",
    "Is Moia right? Is this Saradomin's work?",
    "Tuska. I see.",
    "I've faced overwhelming battles and been forced to retreat. I've been forced to leave people behind - good soldiers. It never gets easier and no one ever forgives you.",
    "It's worth a lot. Thank you.",
    "Vicendithas...",
    "Kerapac. We were friends once, I think. You can't want this.",
    "*cough* *cough* This...air...",
    "I feel it. World Guardian, can't you?",
    "I didn't say anything.",
    "Peace, Lady Seren. Peace. We'll find a way to fix this. You mentioned Zaros?",
    "You should go back to the cradle. Kerapac and the others are waiting.",
    "Player? What happened? We heard a disturbance, and I thought to come up and help...",
    "Are you all right?",
    "Kerapac! What happened to you?",
    "Wait.",
    "I know it isn't my place, but I need to say something, one father to another. Don't you have something to say to Vicendithas?",
    "An apology, perhaps? You haven't been the best father to him. Now might be your only chance to make amends.",
    "Hatred, rage, and revenge. See what comes of it?",
    "Nothing but tragedy.",
    "We should go back to the halls. I left Adrasteia with Seren - we ought to see how they are.",
    "Peace, Moia. Family is sacred.",
    "Seren - I understand. You would do anything to keep them from harm, wouldn't you?",
    "I know that feeling. I know its power, and how it can lead us to make...poor choices.",
    "You've lived for so long, Seren. You've seen so much life, joy, beauty. So many families with as much right to life as your own.",
    "We can help you. We won't let them suffer.",
    "On Iaia, we believe a painless, merciful death is a gift, given out of love. Those who pass peacefully with their family by their side are blessed above all others. It's something to be embraced.",
    "Bring the eggs to Iaia. Not to hatch - but to pass, with you watching over them.",
    "This tomb of a world is no place for it. On Iaia, though, we can give them the proper rites. A gift from my people to yours.",
    "You can let them go peacefully, and save us all.",
    "It will be quick. They won't suffer, I can promise you that.",
    "Of course.",
    "It is a wondrous world. Although there aren't many of my people left - only a few villages - it is beautiful. There is no better place on which to live out our days.",
    "We have everything we need. Food from the land and water, the freshest rain you could ever feel, a kind sun, to be enjoyed from the shade of the trees. More than that, we have peace.",
    "I have seen so much war in my time. To know that my home is safe...that is a great comfort.",
    "It is the most natural part of life. Without it, life is meaningless.",
    "So will you let us help? We can end this now. You don't have to face it alone.",
    "What?",
    "No - that's not what I meant...",
    "No!",

    "I concur.",

    "It is something gradual. Gentle. Not this...annihilation at the hands of a god.",

    "Thank you for your help, Player. At least this way, some of us will live.",
    "We will go to the next village to continue the evacuation. Give us all the time you can.",
    "But the gate closed.",
    "The rune...cracked.",
    "Which means that Iaia...",

    "Gone...",
    "Leave me. Just...leave me.",

    "Here. I managed to grab it before we left Iaia.",
    "Vicendithas wanted to talk to you, should you drop by.",
    "I am alive. I breathe and feel, though knowing what I did to Iaia...I wonder if I deserve even that.",
    "You are kind, Player. I will always be grateful for how you tried to save us.",
    "I was the one who put the idea in her head. I brought the End of Days to my home.",
    "...",
    "Leave me, please.",
    "I'm afraid not.",
    "As well as could be expected. Anachronia suits them. They have a future here, along with the other pioneers.",
    "I hoped to die there one day. I'm so old, Player. One day it will overcome me.",
    "I hoped I would take my last breaths under the red moon of Akash, and be buried by the tree my father planted when I hatched. I ought to have returned to the Olun'dai, but now not even that remains.",
    "The remains of my people mourn too. I am not alone in that. But they are looking to the future, my daughter among them, and I...can't.",
    "I counsel against hate and yet I hate that this world has kept turning. Survival is victory, is it not? Yet how dare I survive, when everything that matters is gone?",
    "You did everything you could. I do not blame you. This is all because of me.",
    "I don't expect you to understand.",
    "Very well.",
    "Vicendithas...what is this?",
    "It's not real, is it?",
    "Why did you do this?",
    "Wrong?",
    "No - Vicendithas - this is a wonder. We can rebuild here.",
    "Not much - but enough to maintain our traditions. To keep the Olun'dai flowing.",
    "I must tell the others. And you, Vicendithas, as an elder of my people I can offer you this in return.",
    "You will always have a place among us as our brother and our son, should you wish it.",
    "Whyever not? Your work has given us a future twice over.",
    "First you took Kerapac's efforts and saw them through to the end.",
    "Work that you finished, after he gave up.",
    "And now we have this, a place to keep our history alive...because of you!",
    "How can I not attempt to recognise that?",
    "Besides, even if you hadn't succeeded, even if we had nothing - you deserve a family as much as any of us.",
    "Come, both of you. We have much to rebuild.",
    "Some of my people are building within the dream. Please assist them if you can.",
    "Any resources you can spare from your Anachronia base camp will be welcome.",
    "In return, we can offer you knowledge in different skills, following our own traditions.",

    "The glacytes are forming on top of the aqueduct. The portal to reach the aqueduct still functions, but the Arch-Glacor's proximity interferes with it.",
    "Light the braziers to weaken the Arch-Glacor's influence. When the portal activates, use it, and it will take you to the source of the glacytes.",

    "You cannot harm me.",

    "Oh be quiet, child. Your sniping serves no value other than to irritate. Much like the rest of your pathetic existence. Where is Seren? Where are the eggs?",
    "No. I have no love for the Elder Gods and no desire to see their plan come to fruition. But as Vicendithas so succinctly put, my will is not my own.",
    "Then I would crush the eggs beneath my feet. I would turn the full power of the Needle on Jas herself, even if it would see me destroyed.",

    "You really thought you could just outrun me?",
    "No matter where you run. No matter how far you go. I will find you. I will be there. The Needle's power lets me rework time itself.",
    "Perhaps. But what good is that when all I have are moments of free will, before her will seizes me.",
    "You stand no chance against me, what chance do you think you stand against one of the creators of the universe? Even her voice would destroy you. One word and you would be killed instantly.",

    "I cannot abandon my search, but I can drag my heels on this world for a time longer. It won't give you long to find a solution. But it's more time than you would have otherwise.",
    "Be sure, World Guardian, I don't do this for you. I do this for me. For a chance at vengeance, however small, however slight, against the Roakin. Know that I would die a thousand times over just to see her hurt.",

    "As much as I was able. So... Seren came home. Where is she?",
    "Is this portal your doing, World Guardian?",

    "I've worked with shadow anima before, boy. I know all too well what it can do.",
    "Jas approaches. Quickly, now. Do you have a plan?",
    "She would never fall for such an obvious trap.",
    "Such a trap would not work indefinitely. The Needle is of the Elders' creation. It will not hold her forever.",
    "Ludicrous. The Needle is not a weapon.",
    "I should have known better than to leave this to you.",
    "She is coming.",
    "I...I defied her.",
    "She gave me no orders about what to do once she had found the eggs. So I used the Needle against her.",
    "We are now a few minutes prior to her arrival. The Needle suffers under such a strain. I cannot ask it to defy its creators indefinitely, but I have given you time, World Guardian.",
    "Jas will return, inevitably, but she is delayed. Don't waste a moment.",
    "No. There's nothing strong enough to harm her - in this universe, anyway.",
    "The portal. It goes to the source of all shadow anima - I can tell. I've never felt it in such intensity.",
    "It is poisonous to her, just as it is to us. Your companions are already suffering its effects, stoic as they are about it. It burns the edges of their souls, the most pure and perfect of all corruptions.",
    "But you, World Guardian - you don't feel a thing.",
    "What are you, World Guardian? What shadow-souled monstrosity could survive this onslaught?",
    "I am bound to the Needle. While it remains whole, I live, but you have no such power.",
    "You stand there on the brink of Erebus like it means nothing! Like it's not even touching you!",
    "What ARE you?",
    "She's almost here. I can turn back time again when she arrives to keep her at bay, but I don't know how many more times I can repeat such an act.",
    "World Guardian - whatever you are - move swiftly. We can't touch Jas. The forces of Erebus can.",
    "Go through the portal. Find something: a weapon, an ally, a beast... Anything that will poison her. Then bring it here, so we might end her tyranny for good.",
    "Hurry. Before she kills us all.",
    "You are using the extra time Erebus offers. Do you wish to stop?",
    "You're not using the extra time Erebus offers. Do you wish to?",
    "You came close to death inside. By rewinding time, I brought you back, but the Needle is breaking.",
    "Did you find anything that might help us?",
    "You enter the dread realm of Erebus, progenitor of shadow anima itself, and merely complain of not being able to run.",
    "What I wouldn't give for that power, World Guardian.",
    "Keep going. Navigating Erebus will become easier once you have attuned yourself to it.",
    "Now get back in there and find something that will drive Jas away.",
    "Good. Use them where you can.",
    "Then find a way to make them open.",
    "Such essences will have power. See if you can find a way to use them.",
    "Thus revealing new paths for traversal, I'm sure.",
    "There may be other kinds of souls in there. Their power may give different effects.",
    "So you have. See if you can discover what it does.",

    "It could work to our advantage if they could.",

    "A tool. I'm working with the Ilujanka to resolve the problem of their infertility, which appears related to the anima of their homeworld, Iaia.",
    "To help me investigate, I've been attempting to build a device for precisely measuring the ambient anima of a world.",
    "No, no, not like that.",
    "As I understand it, from the enchanter Charos, the Measure is too narrow in scale. It was made for small, finely tuned adjustments. I need something that acts on a planar scale.",
    "When he tried to break into my lab to steal Nodon technology, yes.",
    "I put a stop to that particular plan, but he did persuade me to strike a deal.",
    "He needed my hardware for his enchanting and I needed his anima knowledge for my Ilujanka experiments - the exchange proved mutually beneficial. He was the one who told me about the Measure, and about the Locator, too.",
    "Another Elder Artefact. It was claimed by Saradomin centuries ago. I believe he's in the habit of wearing it as signifier of his rank as a god.",
    "Oh?",
    "It's been stolen?",
    "Maddening. The Locator is closer to what I need - what we need, in fact. It has the ability to search for artefacts of power on a given plane.",
    "It can't search for the eggs themselves - the Elders shielded them from its effects - but it has the reach the Measure lacks, and its effect could be adapted to find other power sources.",
    "It will, when I have more time to perfect it. Right now, it's...rather blunt. And I've only tested it on Gielinor.",
    "If, however, I could make it portable, building off some existing source of power, and if I could use it on another world...it could be used to look for exceptional anima signatures elsewhere.",
    "Three Elder God eggs would certainly be exceptional. They would warp the runescape of any world they ended up on - change the anima of it far beyond normal fluctuations.",
    "That...would be ideal, considering what I need. Portable. A strong power source. Yes, that would help immensely. Is it in your possession?",
    "Go collect it from him and bring it here, then. Let us see what it can do.",
    "Bring it here, then. Let us see what it can do.",
    "You don't appear to be carrying the Measure with you still. Go fetch it.",
    "Good.",
    "Hmm. I believe I can make this work with my device. Excuse me for a moment.",
    "Keep it down, please. I'm trying to focus.",
    "If Seren is gone, what is the state of the battle?",
    "Have they found a way to kill my father yet?",
    "A pity.",
    "He is entirely to blame. If it weren't for his hubris...",
    "It doesn't matter. We're not having this argument again. My family affairs are still none of your business.",
    "But nothing. Be quiet or leave my lab.",
    "I'm almost done.",
    "They are infertile and have been dying out for centuries, for so long that many of them have given up hope of ever recovering.",
    "It's quite touching, actually, in a tragic way. I've visited Iaia and spoken to many of them over the course of my research. Most of their elders have accepted extinction as their fate.",
    "They call it The End of Days, and they're at peace with it. The younger ones haven't quite given up yet, though, and so I am working on a cure for them.",
    "...",
    "My father began this work, before he doomed us all. I plan to succeed where he abandoned it.",
    "There. One adapted Measure. Only lightly blasphemous, but I doubt the Roakin will care.",
    "It's stable. All working as expected. Good.",
    "Let me see...",
    "I'm not detecting anything unusual. Gielinor's runescape is normal. I don't think the eggs are still here.",
    "The evidence strongly suggests that, yes.",
    "Have you contacted your allies yet? Tell them that Seren has taken the eggs away from Gielinor.",
    "Allow me to leave my lab in an appropriate state and I will join you.",
    "A chance to use an elder artefact on different worlds...if the end of the universe wasn't on the horizon, this would be exciting.",
    "In the far west of Gielinor, south of the mountain called Eagles' Peak and west of the city of Ardougne.",
    "Allow me to leave my lab in an appropriate state and I will join you at the World Gate.",
    "We've not met.",
    "I am. What of it?",
    "Lead the way.",
    "We should go through the world gate to look for Seren.",
    "Beautiful, yes, but deadly. Watch yourselves. The elves that remained on this world have transformed into mindless beasts.",
    "They've infused themselves with the crystals of this world and have become unstable as a result. It seems to offer remarkable morphogenic properties, but the cost on their sanity is overwhelming.",
    "Would it be better to phrase it in a parable? Or perhaps a song? The truth is the truth, there's no reason to dress it up to make it prettier.",
    "The most venomous creatures have the brightest colours, but yes, this world has its charm.",
    "I can't tell from here. I'll need to take a few readings to see if the runescape of this world has been altered by the eggs' presence.",
    "We'll need to investigate the area. Fortunately this world is covered in crystal formations, so it should just be a case of checking them for irregularities in the runescape.",
    "We should head towards the old settlement and examine the crystals nearby. If Seren went anywhere it would likely be there.",
    "We need to calibrate the measuring device. This world's crystal formations are unique at retaining resonances. Try investigating nearby crystals, like this one here.",
    "Fascinating. The crystals really do resonate in a unique manner. It's as if they are harmonising their anima together.",
    "A crude analogy would say they're a choir singing the same song.",
    "Nothing quite so fanciful as absorbed essence. They have been altered to share similar properties perhaps. But these are unstable, imperfect. I believe the crystals in Prifddinas are more refined.",
    "For one, they'll hold the resonance much longer. These crystals have long since lost their effectiveness, which would explain the decline of the local population.",
    "This again? It's nothing to do with you.",
    "Then you and he are very different people, Hannibus. You knew him for mere days. I've had the misfortune of knowing him my whole life. I am nothing to him.",
    "I am but a tool to him, or perhaps an unwanted servant. Nothing more. He doesn't even care enough to hate me.",
    "I was useful to him for a time, and when that time ran its course, I was cast aside.",
    "Enough of that. These crystals are telling me nothing. We should try and find one of the locals and see if they know anything more.",
    "Nothing changes. You stride in here with the arrogance to believe that you are the smartest person on the planet and then as always you're completely wrong. She's not here.",
    "Wrong again. We're not hiding her from you at all. We're trying to find her.",
    "When you're quite done bickering, we should look around for signs of Seren. See if there are any strong anima traces remaining. It shouldn't be difficult on a dead world like this.",
    "Nothing here either. No sign of life. No trace of anima. This planet is utterly dead.",
    "Not terribly surprising considering. We should look elsewhere, just to be sure. But I suspect she's not here.",
    "What is this obsession with the relationship between me and my father? Hannibus keeps pestering me about it, now you?",
    "To what end? He has all the power, yes, but he lacks the will. Leveraging a relationship with him offers nothing.",
    "If I wanted to gain, I would need to forge a relationship with the one who holds his leash. Do you think Jas needs a friend?",
    "I suspect this leash is very well made.",
    "We wouldn't be so lucky. You're like a cockroach, I don't think anything will ever really kill you.",
    "My pathetic existence? Shall we stop for a moment to examine yours? The great and mighty Kerapac a slave to the very beings he fought against. Laid low by his own hubris. AGAIN!",
    "The people of Kethsi were heavy users of the stone. The world might have a strong enough residual energy signature to disguise the new eggs for a while. It's as good a guess as anywhere.",
    "We need nothing from him.",
    "What are you suggesting?",
    "But one that did give me an idea.",
    "Only one egg was ever in use on Kethsi. But what if instead we looked at a world where all the eggs had been?",
    "What if we looked for a world where the eggs had already hatched?",
    "Precisely! We should try there next.",
    "She's here.",
    "It's not that precise. She is close by, and that's all I can say.",
    "It could be Kerapac.",
    "Don't get too close. The readings I'm getting...",
    "We should go back to the Halls. This place is flooded with shadow anima - It's not safe. Seren needs to tell us what this means.",
    "One giving off enough shadow anima to kill any of us.",
    "He's here.",
    "We know. Don't get close.",
    "This isn't hurting you?",
    "They just...defeated Jas.",
    "The greatest of the Roakin. The ceaseless curse-bringer.",
    "She's...gone.",
    "And I need no apology from you either.",
    "An apology implies that your opinion of me matters. Once, that was true, but now I know better.",
    "I have succeeded where you have failed. I have brought hope to the Ilujanka where your research found only dead ends. When I thought I had to live up to your standards, to your...greatness...",
    "I would have done anything to know that you cared.",
    "But now, you should be looking up to me, trying to live up to my standards. An Ilujankan pastkeeper once told me 'be a better man than your father'.",
    "It's a nice mantra to live your life by, a good life lesson. But I realised something long ago.",
    "I always have been.",
    "So don't worry, Kerapac, I don't need an apology. Like you, it just wouldn't matter.",
    "...",
    "We should go back to the halls. There's nothing more for us here.",
    "Jas was pulled into the portal - I saw it with my own eyes. I saw a shadow monstrosity attack her.",
    "Something tells me we don't have to worry about her again.",
    "What do you propose?",
    "Perhaps for now, but think of what they'll do when they are grown.",
    "I've seen the evil the Roakin are capable of. I was pinned under the sharp end of it for much of my life. Preventing another generation from doing the same will do more good than harm.",
    "To some, perhaps.",
    "This ...",
    "This is Iaia.",
    "Oh, no...",
    "How dare you! Iaia is not yours! The Ilujanka have the right to a future!",
    "The World Gate. Hannibus, what's the quickest route to the other villages?",
    "With respect, Oldest One, there isn't time.",
    "Oldest One...you really wish to stay? There's a future for you on Gielinor if you wish. You don't need to do this to yourself.",
    "The elders here know me. I will see if I can change a few minds.",
    "I've convinced who I can to leave. With luck, I can change a few more minds before it's too late.",
    "I have an idea.",
    "You need one inventory space to take these.",
    "These might help.",
    "The shards of the Needle. I collected them on Freneskae. I thought I could use them in my research, somehow.",
    "This is more important, though.",
    "The Needle manipulated time and space. Its shards won't be as powerful as the real thing, of course, but if you place them around the eggs it should slow down their hatching.",
    "I can assist. My adapted Measure can find the optimal locations for the shards. I will highlight them for you.",
    "Be careful. Seren will do anything to protect the eggs now. If she attacks...be ready.",
    "What have you done with the Needle shards I gave you...",
    "Good job there were others. Make some space and I can give you them.",
    "Place the shards at my markers, quickly!",
    "We must delay her so the others can evacuate the nearby villages.",
    "Use the shards to slow the hatching eggs - and keep her distracted from calling in the Elders, no matter what she throws at you.",
    "Give the evacuation all the time you can.",
    "Don't waste a shard by placing it there. Place them at my markers.",
    "Quick, World Guardian. Place another shard whilst Seren is distracted.",
    "Seren is distracted. Quickly place another shard!",
    "Get to the point.",
    "It's four against one.",
    "I've been teleporting them to Anachronia. The pioneer Ilujanka took them in.",
    "I'll stay with him. This is no time for a celebration.",
    "It's not your fault. It was Seren's choice. Player - you go on. I'll take him to Anachronia when this is all over.",
    "I am, actually. I need your help for this one. Do you have the final shard of the Needle?",
    "Thank you.",
    "Might I borrow it? It's the final component I need.",
    "If it works, I'll tell you. If not...I suppose I'll tell you too. Let me try it first, though.",
    "Both of you come here. Time to see if this works. Here - put your hand on the shard.",
    "Please just trust me. You too, Hannibus. I want us all to be there.",
    "It worked!",
    "My gift to the Ilujanka. It's not much, but given the limited readings I took with the Measure, it's the best I can do.",
    "No. It's not real, not in the physical, literal sense, but it's as close as I can make it.",
    "The Measure took readings of the planet's runescape; the shard of the Needle contained an imprint of Iaia's final days.",
    "Together with my Nodon brethren's dreamscape technology, I am able to generate this recreation, this dream - a small part of what was lost.",
    "Though, if reality is what we can see, touch, smell and feel, then yes - perhaps this is real. Does reality need to be crafted from stone and metal?",
    "A dream is reality to the dreamer whilst they sleep, is it not?",
    "You have shown me such kindness. You tried to guide me from the path of hatred that destroyed my father, and...well, I was cruel in my response.",
    "I didn't deserve the chances you gave me and yet you gave them anyway. I had to do something to relieve your grief.",
    "If it's wrong...if it's an abomination...then I beg your forgiveness and I will never attempt such a thing again. But I had to try.",
    "You would let me join your people?",
    "Me?",
    "I don't know if I can accept...",
