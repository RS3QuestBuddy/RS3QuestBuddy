    "I feared as much. Ghosts, demons... How could this have happened to us?",
    "Well, I suppose I should thank you. Hopefully now they can rest in peace.",

    "No. The little girl is you. Like I said.",
    "That's because you are the little girl.",
    "Then who are you? What are you?",
    "But why do you look like that?",
    "And who was Rowena?",

    "How?",
    "But the main hall is dangerous. There's an energy field.",
    "Well, that finishes what I came here to do. I need to report back that the ghost has gone. What are you going to do now?",
    "I found him and put him to rest. It was the ghost of Ormod Gulvas, who originally built this mansion.",

    "And what would that be?",
    "I dreamed of that. Lenian. Rowena wanted to play with him. I believe I can help you.",
