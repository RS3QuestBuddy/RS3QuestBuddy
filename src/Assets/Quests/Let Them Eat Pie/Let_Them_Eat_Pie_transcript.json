    "Well I suppose that's not so bad...but why? Can't I get the seal off him now?",
    "I suppose not.",

    "You're all heart, aren't you?",
    "But that's profiting on their misery!",

    "Yeah, sure. Why not?",

    "Yes. He's certainly not going to be on anything but infirmary food for a while either. I can only hope they manage to get the stains out of the ceiling...",
    "So what do I need to do now?",
    "Do I have to go up there? The stench is horrible!",
    "Maybe if I hold my breath...",
    "Urgh...that smell!",
    "I have the seal for you!",
    "Right, will do!",
    "That seems pretty straightforward!",
    "That seems pretty straightforward!",
    "Urgent message for you, sir.",
    "It is from Rolo the Stout. I think he said it was something about opening the food stores.",
    "No, but he is your boss. So I guess that means you have to do it.",
    "Well that worked. I should go and tell Nails.",
    "He bought it! He should be opening the stores any minute now.",
    "No problem, and with Rolo out of the picture things should start to pick up as well.",
    "Well, if they do, we can always serve up another slice of piping hot justice!",
    "Fair enough. How're things here?",
    "Thanks, Nails. How're things here?",
    "Hello Nails, how are things going?",

    "What's the matter?",
    "Oh come on, I'm sure things aren't that bad.",
    "Uh...",
    "You're...welcome.",
    "Saw what?",
    "Well...isn't this a bit over the top from seeing Rolo get a little ill?",

  "Nails Newton": [
    "Hey, you looking for work?",
    "Just a little job I need doing. See, there's a merchant upstairs I need something lifting from. I'd do it myself, but I'm more into the 'legitimate' document business these days.",
    "Keep your voice down! Look, he's not a very nice bloke, right? He's Rolo the Stout, and he's currently buying up all the food in the area on the cheap and selling it to the refugees at a huge mark-up.",
    "Just listen will ya? All I need is his seal. I've a forged letter right here that says he's releasing all the food to the refugees for free. If I can get his personal seal, then I can get his associates to open the stockpiles to the people of the town. You in, or not?",
    "Well, Rolo isn't called 'the stout' because he likes to drink the stuff. He's a real pig. Every day he orders some fancy pie from the cook here, usually something that'll cost a lot to make. So, what we'll do is make a pie that'll put him out of commission for some time.",
    "Not POISON poison. Just something that'll put him in the infirmary for a while.",
    "Nah, he has it in a chest up there by his table in case he needs to stamp any documents. If he's rushed off to hork his guts out I don't think his first priority will be taking it with him.",
    "Exactly. So what I need you to do first is take care of the most complex item in the recipe: the pie crust. What we're going to do is mix in a load of fishing bait into the flour.",
    "Do you know about the watermill to the south? What ya need to do is take some wheat and fishing bait there. You can get wheat from a field to the south of here, just over the bridge. There are a couple of troll bodies on the way to the field that have been left for a while. They have a lot of maggo...err, 'fishing bait' around them. Upstairs there is a hopper. Put the wheat in the hopper, then put the fishing bait on top. Once you have done that, use the lever nearby to put it all in the mill, then it'll all get mashed up. Then go back downstairs and use a pot to gather up the flour and bring it to me.",
    "If you don't have a pot on ya, why not go see Mess Sergeant Ramsey in the tavern there? He's probably got one you can have for free in that shop of his. Or you can just make them, for free, if you can get some clay.",
    "Well what do you wanna know?",
    "Huh... Well, I suppose that's fair enough. My name's 'Nails' Newton. I'm a Burthorpe man, born and bred. I've been working various scams and schemes since I was little. These days, I provide accurate copies of official documents to people. In case they can't get the real version for some silly reason. A good steady hand is invaluable, you see.",
    "You could say that...but look at it this way. I never beat up anyone that wasn't asking for it, stole anything from someone that couldn't afford it, or scammed anyone that wasn't trying to scam me. I mean, I did some work back in the day, making sure people got some money that was owed them from people who wouldn't give it any other way. That's what gets me about these merchants. They're gouging us for every coin we've got because they can profit off our misery. I may be a little shady, but at least I have standards.",
    "Look, go and talk to them and you'll find out. Rolo is just a tip of a flabby iceberg. Just have a word with his friend Kepple, or any of the merchants wandering around. Then you'll see what we're up against.",

    "You know what? That's not a problem. I mean[sic] think about it. We WANT the pie to be undercooked and a health-hazard. So just bung it in the oven until the top goes a little bit crispy and you're fine.",
    "Ok, see you about.",
    "Well that was pretty blunt. I'll be waiting here if you change your mind. I tell you what,[sic] why not go upstairs and speak to Rolo if you think I'm a little harsh, eh?",

I want you to go and get one and bury it in a field. Just shove it right into the dirt and then let it...[sic] ripen for a bit.",
    "Just use either the flax field, wheat field or the animal pen for the job. The flax field is closest. It's in the north west of here, near the Master Farmer's shop and the well. And don't forget: when you are done you should come and see me to show me your work. But first, let me take care of that flour for ya!",

    "If you don't have a potato then Head Farmer Jones might well have one you can use.",
    "Kebbit burrows are full of hair and droppings and all other kinds of nasty waste. So if you just shove it in there and pull it out it'll be ok. Well, I say 'ok'...",

    "Because my nose hairs aren't bleaching. It's subtle clues like that which give it away.",
    "Now you have everything, you should stick the crayfish and potato inside the shell and take it to the range to cook.",

    "Oh, that's no problem. One of the other thieves in the tavern found the terrible pie and gave it to me.",
    "Well this is pretty simple. All you really need to do is use the uncooked pie on a range to cook it.",
    "Yea. Then bring it to me so I can have a look, ok?",

    "Guh...that thing stinks!",
    "He'll never eat that unless we do something to mask the smell. I have an idea though.",
    "One of Rolo's fellow merchants, Foppish Pierre[sic] has been hanging around the mill. He carries a supply of spices on him all the time. If you can pickpocket those then we'll be in business. So, just go and grab those spices from Pierre and add them to the pie. Then you can take it up to Rolo and see if he swallows it.",
    "That was quick. How did it go?",
    "I need you to go and grab something to cover up that pie's stench. There's a guy called Foppish Pierre that hangs out near the watermill to the south of here. He's carrying some pretty fancy spices on his person. Just go and nick them off him, dump them on the pie, and take it off to Rolo to eat. Any questions?",

    "Well, dump a good serving of them onto the pie to mask the flavour and ungodly stench. Then go and serve it to Rolo.",
    "Any more questions?",
    "You don't know how valuable this stuff is?",
    "Spices are big business, my friend! Depending on the spice, it can be worth fifty, even sixty times its weight in gold! Workers that handle the stuff can't even wear roll-ups on their trousers in case they sneak some out in them. A cuff-full can be worth more than a year's wages. You know why he carries it around? So he can take it out and wave it about like others would wear magical jewels.",
    "You mean this one?",
    "I...don't...know?",
    "How are things going?",
    "Is this about what to do next? Because all you need to do is go up and give the pie to Rolo.",
    "Go for it. What's up?",
    "Well, if you've got the spiced pie, you need to go and take it to Rolo.",
    "Stand well back!",
    "Well, Rolo certainly won't be causing any more trouble for a while.",
    "Don't! Don't even talk about that. I'm still queasy from seeing what he did to the stairs as they called him out. They had to sluice them down with buckets and mops...terrible. But at least the stains are all gone now.",
    "Well, with Rolo out the way you can go and steal the seal from his chest. We'd best move fast, in case he decides to send for it when he comes round. Is there anything else you need to know?",
    "Go upstairs and get Rolo's seal for me.",
    "I know. The owner has called for an old priest and a young priest. When the pair get here they hope that an exorcism will get rid of it.",
    "Great, let's get this letter stamped, and...",
    "Done! Now just take it to Pierre and we're home free Don't forget to come back and see me when you are done, ok?",
    "Well, what's the matter? I need you to take that letter I gave you to Foppish Pierre down to the watermill.",
    "Well now we have the seal and the forged letter, it is all plain sailing!",
    "Well, what's the matter? I need you to take that letter I gave you to Foppish Pierre down to the watermill.",
    "Well now we have the seal and the forged letter, it is all plain sailing!",
    "Well, looks like we're done. I'll let the refugees know. We'll have a good old fashioned feast. And it's all thanks to you! We'll raise a glass or two to you tonight!",
    "There is that. Hopefully the food situation will improve, unless someone else muscles in on the racket.",
    "Good point! But for now, let's celebrate!",
    "I have some pies for you by the way, but you need to clear your inventory before I can give them to ya.",
    "I have that spice-pouch you took from Pierre.",
    "You should make some room for it and take it off me; it'll be of use to ya.",
    "Here, you should have it. It'll come in handy for making ya food more palatable.",
    "Hello. They are going quite well now the food stores have been opened.",
    "I'm seeing a lot of well-fed people, instead of one disgustingly well-fed person.",
    "I have some pies for you by the way, but you need to clear your inventory before I can give them to ya.",
    "On which note, here, have these pies as a reward.",
    "And they even managed to get the smell out of the upper floor, which is a bonus.",
    "Well what do you wanna know?",
    "Huh, well, I suppose that's fair enough. My name's 'Nails' Newton. I'm a Burthorpe man, born and bred. I've been working various scams and schemes since I was little. These days, I provide accurate copies of official documents to people. In case they can't get the real version for some silly reason. A good steady hand is invaluable, you see.",

    "They were going to take him to the infirmary, then they realised that it was a bit too serious. I mean, obviously, given his condition they couldn't heal him normally: by feeding him large amounts of food.",
    "Again, no. All the damage that Rolo had done to himself guzzling food meant it was too serious for that.",
    "No, no, he's still alive. But they had to take him to a specialist clinic. Apparently they have confined him to an iron bowel."

    "I'm Winston Kepple, purveyor of pretty much everything! I came here with my friends and colleagues from Falador to take advantage of this captive market that we have right here. And let me tell you, business has never been better.",
    "I mean that with the trolls attacking I've been able to peddle all kinds of goods to these rubes with an astonishing mark-up! Food, clothing, cake tins, fishing supplies... You name it, I make am making a profit on it.",
    "Pfft. What about it? If the trolls wipe this place out the White Knights and some scruffy tramps with swords calling themselves heroes will take care of it. And then the survivors will need even more supplies to reclaim the land!",
    "Oh pipe down. I didn't expect a commoner like you to understand the ways of high finance.",
    "Turning a healthy profit! The folk here are too poor to set up elsewhere, or too thick-headed to give up. My friends and I can sell them a one-coin shirt for fifteen, and they can't exactly shop around! So long as this war keeps going, we're going to be raking it in!",
    "Well, you might say that, but there's a lot of history between here and my home.",
    "You see, Falador and Burthorpe have always had this rivalry going, due to them not liking the White Knights or something equally childish. So, we're loving this. You may well think were[sic] scum here, but back home in Falador - well, they are not quite so eager to judge us.",
    "Well what they don't know won't hurt them, will it? I'll bet you're one of those 'hero' types, aren't you? A bleeding heart and a burning desire to help everyone. It's numbskulls like you, giving your gear away or dropping it for people to find, that are ruining my business!",
    "I'm glad you like it. It is, theoretically, very expensive.",
    "Well, I had it made from the finest materials, purchased from businesses that I was a partner in, so I got a good discount. Then I had the finest seamstresses in Falador put out of work, and paid them a pittance to make it for me before I would let them seek employment elsewhere. So in the end I have a very wonderful set of clothes with little or no cost to myself.",
    "Yes, it is quite jaw-droppingly good, isn't it?",
    "Very well, it was...nice talking to you.",
    "I saw it. I saw all of it...",
    "You don't know! You'll never know what I saw! The colours...all the colours...and sometimes NONE of the colours... The darkness came to me then...with the stench, it protected my mind. But the darkness is still there. The smell...The smell of it will never, ever fade...",
    "A little ill? A little ill? The gods themselves wept tears of blood at the things he brought to light. Things that never should have been!",
    "No! Don't leave me! It will come back for me!"

    "Thanks? What for?",
