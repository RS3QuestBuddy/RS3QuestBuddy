    "Hello. Do you need any help? I'm looking for a quest.",
    "Uh, I'm not sure. Who are they?",
    "Seriously, what are you talking about?",
    "Uh... they live in the cold? That's about all.",
    "What do you need my help for?",
    "Okay, why not! But first, who are you and why are you researching penguins?",
    "Oh! Okay then. So, what did you need me to do?",
    "Right, oak planks, steel nails, hammer, spade, east of Rellekka. Got it.",
    "I don't think so.",
    "Yes, I have them with me.",
    "No.",
    "What do I need to get?",
    "Where should I meet you when I have everything?",
    "I have no idea where that is.",
    "No need to be snippy.",
    "Oh, I know where to go.",
    "Never mind.",
    "Yes, I have them with me.",
    "What do I need to get?",
    "Uh, no.",
    "So how do I make a bird hide?",
    "This looks like a good spot for a bird hide.",
    "Okay, I've made the structure. Now what?",
    "I need to cover it in snow before I can use it.",
    "Right, well, the bird hide is done. Are we going to start observing?",
    "Can we start observing the penguins?",
    "Aww, they're cute.",
    "They're just walking around, Larry.",
    "That's crazy!",
    "It looked like one of them shivered and the other one just walked past. Nothing suspicious there, it is really cold here!",
    "Okay, calm down. What do you think we should do now?",
    "It did seem rather suspicious.",
    "Of course! I mean, those penguins were acting quite strangely.",
    "Whoa there. I don't think this calls for hugging. What do we do next about the penguins?",
    "How do you plan to do that?",
    "How do you plan to infiltrate the penguins?",
    "What? We'll just set it off walking? What good will that do?",
    "Wait a minute, why am I being shrunk? Why can't you get in the suit and annoy the penguins?",
    "Gee, that's comforting.",
    "Why do I have to make the suit? I'm tired of doing all the legwork.",
    "Oh, sorry... Hey, you told me you were on leave to do research!",
    "So that's why you can't wear the suit? Because you used to work near them?",
    "Yes, I have it.",
    "I've lost the clockwork book, could I have another?",
    "I'm a bit confused. Can you explain how to make the suit?",
    "Okay, thanks.",
    "No, I'm not done yet.",
    "The hide was destroyed. It's too damaged to rebuild, so we can't use it to observe the penguins any more.",
    "I don't think it was the penguins. You can't even make out the prints clearly, it could have been anything.",
    "It looks like a warning message to keep us away. I didn't think penguins were violent by nature.",
    "Well, there aren't any penguins around now, so we can't try out the suit.",
    "There are other penguins. What about the ones at the Zoo? At least we can test the suit on them.",
    "Then why the whole malarkey with the boat?",
    "Guess we should try this out. How do you know a shrinking spell, anyway?",
    "Larry, you are one unlucky dude.",
    "Seems like a pretty wise old man.",
    "Right, well we don't have all day. Time to be a penguin!",
    "Right, right. Let's just get this over with. Penguin time!",
    "Squack! Quack, quackity squack, squee.",
    "I'm, uh, speaking penguin, I think. WAIT. How come you can speak in the common tongue? You're a penguin!",
    "Oh, right. Yes, of course! Uh, I was just, uh, testing you. Making sure you're on your toes, claws, whatever.",
    "I better try and get this greeting right.",
    "*Whew, that was right. Two more moves to do. If I get those right, he should speak to me.*",
    "*I just need to do one more move and I'll have gotten the greeting right.*",
    "Uh, the main directive? Yeah... sure, I made progress with it. It was... easy?",
    "Uh, yeah. I just kind of jumped off a hill and flapped a lot.",
    "I also launched myself out of a cannon!",
    "Then I flew in a hot air balloon.",
    "Why is this so important? I mean, we're good swimmers, who cares if we can't fly?",
    "You sound kind of bitter.",
    "Anything I can do?",
    "I lost your mission report. Can I have another?",
    "Why do I need to go to Lumbridge?",
    "Where is the outpost?",
    "You mean they aren't the same?",
    "Okay, I'm ready to be big again! Please get me out of this.",
    "The penguin gave me his mission report and told me to go to Lumbridge to speak to the penguins there and then go to 'the outpost'.",
    "Maybe the penguins in Lumbridge are undercover? I didn't find out where their outpost is. I'm hoping the ones in Lumbridge will tell me. Seems kind of crazy that these penguins have mission reports and operatives.",
    "They don't even have thumbs. How organised can they be?",
    "So, we're in Lumbridge. Where are these penguins?",
    "Hmm, I suppose.",
    "I should probably do the secret handshake before I try talking to these penguins.",
    "I can't speak to the penguins when I'm not in my disguise.",
    "But I gave the correct greeting. You have to talk to me.",
    "But the penguins at the Zoo sent me. They spoke to me without some phrase.",
    "The Lumbridge penguins won't talk to me without some stupid secret phrase. These penguins are crazy!",
    "The penguins in Lumbridge refuse to talk to me. They keep demanding a secret phrase.",
    "Pesca-what?",
    "Oh, where all of the penguins... I mean us... live?",
    "You sound pretty homesick. Can't you go and visit Palingrad?",
    "Gee, I sure would like to get back, too. If only you'd tell me the phrase, so I could get the other mission report and move on.",
    "Uh, I forgot what the phrase was.",
    "I must have left the outpost before they gave out the phrase.",
    "Is it Rumpelstiltskin?",
    "I need that phrase! Isn't there anything you can do?",
    "Sure!",
    "Hmm, no I'll hang on to it.",
    "Where is the outpost?",
    "You mean they aren't the same?",
    "Never mind.",
    "I got the phrase! These penguins are so weird. It's something about a walrus.",
    "Yeah, and organised. I know.",
    "Do not trust the walrus.",
    "The penguin at the Zoo told me to see if you had any news.",
    "You want me to disguise myself as a human and talk to the Farmer? Seems like a tough request. I'll only do it if you tell me how to get to the outpost.",
    "Are you calling me dumb? Fine. You can talk to the Farmer yourself, and compromise your mission.",
    "Not yet.",
    "They want me to investigate Fred the Farmer.",
    "No, as a human.",
    "Curiouser and curiouser.",
    "I'm looking for something to kill.",
    "I'm lost.",
    "Fred! Fred! I've seen 'The Thing'!",
    "Fred!",
    "FRED!",
    "It's not a shape-shifter or any other kind of monster.",
    "Well, it's just two penguins...disguised as a sheep.",
    "I need to talk to you about penguins.",
    "Hey Fred! You've been messing with the wrong people. You better leave the penguins alone... OR ELSE!",
    "I mean it Fred, I don't know whose side you're working for, but assassinating the penguin operatives is going to get you in trouble. To think you'd even stoop to sending others to try and 'shear' them. Be careful, or you might find you've been shorn.",
    "Don't play neutral with me, Fred. I see right through you. You're probably working for the squirrels, aren't you? I'll be watching Fred. I'm always watching.",
    "You know that 'Thing' out in your field? It's two penguins in disguise.",
    "No, really, it is! They're trying to observe humans to learn our weaknesses.",
    "They probably thought they'd blend in better. Anyway, I came to warn you to not annoy them too much. They're funny little guys but they seem to have a grudge against you.",
    "Yes, I have a penguin suit and I know the secret greeting. I'm infiltrating them because this crazy guy Larry is convinced they are trying to take over the world or something.",
    "HEY! I'm not crazy! Larry's a little left of centre, but I'm just helping him out. The penguins really can talk.",
    "Fine. Don't believe me. Larry and I will prove you wrong. Just don't go near the penguins, Fred, not if you value your life.",
    "I talked to Fred the Farmer. I tried to warn him about the penguins, but he wouldn't believe me!",
    "The Farmer is definitely an enemy. High ranking too. I think. He might even be the King of Lumbridge in disguise!",
    "Well, that's why he's in disguise. Duh.",
    "The Farmer is harmless. The sheep, however... now they seem pretty crafty.",
    "Exactly! So you don't suspect them! That's why they are so cunning. Watch your back.",
    "Hey, wait, you said you'd tell me where the outpost is!",
    "I lost your mission report. Could I have another copy?",
    "Haa haa, this is fun!",
    "I just convinced them Fred the Farmer was the King of Lumbridge!",
    "Exactly! They are so gullible. Even if they are organised.",
    "Sorry. It was just a bit of fun.",
    "I just convinced the penguins that the sheep are agents for the other side.",
    "No! They're just sheep. But I wanted to confuse the penguins. Put them off our scent.",
    "Larry, we need to get you to hang out with people, not animals.",
    "I know where their outpost is! The entrance is on the iceberg. It's concealed by an avalanche.",
    "It's fun for you! You're not risking your neck.",
    "No.... I mean.... Yes. Oh never mind. Just do the spell. Wait, won't the spell wear off once I'm inside? You'll be too far away.",
    "This guy looks official. I'd better do the greeting before I speak to him.",
    "Cabbage.",
    "ID? No one told me anything about ID.",
    "It's just a pile of snow.",
    "The penguin at the entrance said I needed to have an ID. Nobody told me about any ID!",
    "Penguins have black markets?",
    "Uh... maybe?",
    "Well, I've misplaced me, I mean my, ID card.",
    "Yeah, my missin repor'. I think I need one of them too.",
    "What? No, no stabbing.",
    "Tur? Do you mean tar?",
    "So, you need swamp tar and five feathers. Will chicken feathers do?",
    "Yeah, I got it.",
    "What did you need?",
    "Never mind.",
    "Tell me about this black market you run. Seems kind of risky.",
    "Riiiight. Fettuccine Mafia. I'll remember that.",
    "Yeah, I need some replacements.",
    "Noodle gave me the ID and a mission report. I'm all set!",
    "I need to go into the debriefing room to be, well, debriefed!",
    "So what's your job?",
    "It won't open. I think it's controlled from that booth.",
    "I know this great joke. So a penguin walks into a bar...",
    "I need to get through those doors at the end of the hall.",
    "What's going on here?",
    "Hi, could you...",
    "So, what's your job?",
    "What's through those doors at the end of the hall?",
    "It was either that or Pear.",
    "Hippie parents, sir. They had weird ideas about names.",
    "Yes, and I have my mission report. I also have the mission reports from the operatives ion the Ardougne Zoo and the Lumbridge sheep field.",
    "Oh yeah. It was amazing. You know, I just... flapped. Really fast.",
    "It wasn't too bad. I was wearing a helmet at the time.",
    "Well, it was a sack of cloth with a basket attached to the bottom and when you filled it with hot air it went up.",
    "A physical? What, are they going to examine my body?",
    "I have to complete an agility course to prove I'm fit for service! Will the suit be able to handle that?",
    "All those penguins, what are they doing?",
    "Invasion? Of...",
    "What do I do now?",
    "He doesn't look like he wants to talk right now.",
    "Larry, you were right! There's an entire army of them, and they're drilling and... Larry, they're ORGANISED!",
    "I know what I saw! They were doing drills and everything.",
    "War plans! Who are they going to war with?",
    "Where could the room be?",
    "That's a pretty tall order.",
    "Keep your shorts on; I'm working on it.",
    "You look like knowledgeable... penguins. What's through those doors at the end of this hall?",
    "Yes, well, I would like to know what rooms.",
    "Humans can go through?",
    "Who are you? You don't really look like KGP agents.",
    "Penguins have bards?",
    "Sure, I haven't got anything to lose, except my eardrums.",
    "But this room is filled with instruments.",
    "Way harsh, man.",
    "What about a cowbell? You don't need thumbs for that.",
    "Wait, why am I getting these instruments?",
    "I think I have a lead. These two penguin bards seem to know a lot of the history of the iceberg. I think they might know a way into the War Room.",
    "Yeah, that's what I said. Where would I get a cowbell or a set of bongos?",
    "Good plan, Larry.",
    "What did I need to get you?",
    "Yes.",
    "Now might be a good time for me to slip out and get through those doors...",
    "No.",
    "Sounds like Ping and Pong are getting arrested. I better not get involved.",
    "What about me?",
    "Ice Lord... hit me... ow...",
    "Pescaling Pax was there, and he forced me out of the suit and threw me into a cage with the Ice Lords!",
    "There was a map of the world and a lot of little penguin figures.",
    "LARRY! We've just uncovered a plot that could destroy everything we hold dear. Don't you think we should focus on stopping them?",
    "We need to plan our next move, but now they know both our scents and might come after us!"
  ],
  "Larry": [
    "Are you working for them?",
    "EXACTLY!",
    "I think you can be trusted. What do you know about...",
    "penguins?",
    "Would you like to learn more about them? I'm conducting a, uh, research project to, uh, learn more about their social habits in their natural environment.",
    "Well, I need to build a shelter to hide from view, and it's always useful to have an extra pair of eyes, you know, for, uh, observing... penguins. So, are you up for it?",
    "I, uh, was a zookeeper here. But, I, uh, am on leave to go research penguins in their native habitat.",
    "Right. I need you to gather materials for the bird hide, while I arrange for our transport. You need to get 10 oak planks, 10 steel nails, a hammer, and a spade so that we can build a bird hide. Once you have those, meet me up by the entrance to Keldagrim, east of Rellekka. I'll be there with a boat to take us to our destination.",
    "Have you got the equipment?",
    "You have all the materials. Off to the iceberg!",
    "Once you have the items, meet me up by the entrance to Keldagrim, east of Rellekka. I'll be there with a boat to take us to our destination.",
    "And you call yourself an adventurer! There is a road from Catherby going north. Take it until you reach the Sinclair Mansion. Take a left at the Mansion, cross two bridges and follow the road until you reach Rellekka. Head east, around Rellekka to the coast near the entrance of Keldagrim. Did I spell that out enough for you?",
    "Do you have all the items we need?",
    "You have all the materials. Off to the iceberg!",
    "On the way I'll tell you the 42 ways penguins can torture you using a feather...",
    "Did I ever tell you about this one time...",
    "On the way I'll tell you how I learned to teleport. Well, this one time I got stuck in a wall...",
    "On the way I'll tell you how I got this great rucksack. I had this paper hat lying around...",
    "The trip can be rather tedious so I will regale you with stories of my duties at the Zoo. Every morning I had to scoop...",
    "Use the planks on the patch of snow on that ridge. Once you have that constructed, use the spade on the snow to cover the hide.",
    "Not bad... now you need to cover the bird hide in snow with a spade.",
    "Yes. Let's get in and start observing. You should note down anything interesting the penguins do. I'll include it in my, uh, research.",
    "Yes. Let's get in and start observing. You should note down anything interesting the penguins do. I'll include it in my, uh, research.",
    "Look, here come two penguins now.",
    "EVIL. I mean, how fascinating.",
    "Looks like the penguins are on patrol again.",
    "They are organised! ORGANISED I tell you!",
    "I knew it. I knew they were up to something! Did you see that? They were patrolling!",
    "It isn't! They saluted and recognised each other. They're organised!",
    "I don't care what you think. I know they are doing something. No one ever believes me. But I'll prove them wrong. ALL OF THEM.",
    "You believe me?",
    "No one ever believes me. Can I... hug you?",
    "We need to get closer to the penguins. Infiltrate them. Learn what they are doing.",
    "We can't discuss it here; there are too many spies. Let's leave the iceberg and then I'll tell you my plans.",
    "We must get away from here before we discuss our plans. We don't want to be overheard.",
    "I have altered some designs of clockwork toys to make a clockwork penguin suit. We will use this to infiltrate their ranks.",
    "No! I'm going to use a spell to shrink you down so you can control it from the inside.",
    "They penguins know my scent. They'd find me out and capture me and... torture me. No, it has to be you. Don't worry. The spell only works if I'm nearby since I have to be constantly casting it. If trouble starts I'll be close by to help.",
    "Here's the book. It has my designs and a list of things you need to get. Use your Crafting table at your house to build it, just like regular clockwork toys.",
    "You have to make it, because since I got fired from the Zoo I've been homeless. Thanks for caring.",
    "Well... it's permanent leave, and I am doing research! When I used to work at the Zoo, I noticed the penguins doing odd things, like taking notes or timing things. I asked to have my work detail transferred to their cage and I was fired! I'm sure the penguins are behind it. So I kept spying on them and I'll prove everyone wrong!",
    "Err, no. I've had a few run-ins since then. But I don't have time for war stories, we need to concentrate on our mission! When you're done making the suit, we'll head back to the iceberg and try it out.",
    "Do you have the suit?",
    "That's perfect. You are a very skilled [craftsman/crafter]. Now we must return to the iceberg and test it.",
    "You don't seem to have the suit with you.",
    "Well, lucky for you I did make another copy. But be more careful!",
    "You haven't lost it, you just need to look for it more closely.",
    "You need 1 piece of silk, 1 clockwork mechanism, and 1 wood plank. The book will explain how to make the suit. But, since you seem too lazy to read it, I'll summarise. Take the materials to your house and use the Crafting table to make clockwork toys. From there you can make the suit.",
    "Look what they did to the bird hide! It's completely destroyed! The savages. The penguins are on to us.",
    "Well of course you can't make out tracks. Penguins walk single file to hide their numbers! They're clever... so very clever.",
    "Oh, they act like they aren't, but it's all a guise. They wanted to scare us off. We must be on to something.",
    "But we were so close to finding out exactly is going on. It's all ruined now. How will we ever infiltrate them if there are none around to infiltrate?",
    "OF COURSE! You are brilliant. I should have thought of that. It's where all of this started. Let's return to the Zoo. I can teleport us back to the Zoo. It'll be faster.",
    "Boat rides lower my stress level.",
    "I can teleport us back to the Zoo, but you'll have to make your own way back, teleports tire me out.",
    "After I put you in the suit, use the little gate in the enclosure to get inside. The zookeepers won't notice.",
    "Well, a while back I was out in the field observing penguins. I worked for the Ardougne Zoo then. I was just quietly observing them when suddenly there was an avalanche.",
    "I'm not done! I was trapped, but a passing old man stopped to help. He said he would shrink me so I could crawl out from under the weight of the snow. Then he taught me the spell in case I would have need of it again.",
    "You see, that incident made me start suspecting the penguins, and my further work with them at the Zoo just confirmed it. I'm sure they got me fired. I know too much.",
    "Okay, but remember, if you move too far away from me the spell will break and you'll be normal sized again. Also, if you need to switch back, just ask me and I'll unshrink you.",
    "You will need your hands free to operate the suit.",
    "You can't wear a cape inside the suit, it might get caught.",
    "Don't talk to me while you're in the suit! It'll give away your cover. Here, I'll get you out of it.",
    "All right, keep calm. One growth spurt coming up.",
    "Lumbridge? There aren't any penguins in Lumbridge. Not that I've seen. Where is this 'outpost'?",
    "They're organised little devils. Don't underestimate them. You go on ahead to Lumbridge. I'll meet you there and put you in the suit.",
    "I was chatting with a local farmer, and there is a rumour about a 'thing' that lives here. Maybe it's the penguins, and these simple people don't recognise them.",
    "No, I keep trying to tell you, they aren't crazy, they are dangerous and organised. Well, since the penguin at the Zoo is the only one talking to you, maybe you should ask him. I can teleport us back to the Zoo, but you'll have to make your own way back. Teleports tire me out.",
    "You aren't taking this seriously! They are dangerous!",
    "Oh, just go talk to the sheep.",
    "As a penguin?",
    "So, you'll be a human, pretending to be a penguin, pretending to be a human.",
    "Now you know how it feels to be told you're crazy. Go tell the penguins about him.",
    "What? How?",
    "But there is no King of Lumbridge.",
    "Don't take this so lightly. You might put Fred in danger because you were having a laugh.",
    "They are?",
    "What a good plan! I just hope the sheep aren't working for the other side.",
    "Great. Let's go back to the iceberg. I'll put you in your suit and we'll really see what these penguins are up to.",
    "Now you can try and enter the outpost. This is exciting.",
    "But you don't think penguins are dangerous, anyway. So there's no danger is there? Or are you coming around to my thinking that they are dangerous?",
    "Oh, no. The ice magnifies the spell, so it will allow you to go greater distances.",
    "ID? But... they all look alike. Well, the other penguins probably just assumed you had it, since you said you were an agent. You know, I met a rather shifty looking penguin once, north of Miscellania. He was named after some sort of pasta... Anyway, he worked for a black market. Maybe he has a contact here who could get you an ID?",
    "Of course. Just have a look around here for a shifty pasta penguin.",
    "Good luck. Don't let the penguins get the better of you! Just remember, they can't even fly.",
    "Well, get going then!",
    "I can't see why not. Just be careful with it. Come back to me when you have finished and I'll complete any repairs it might need.",
    "That's what I have been saying from the start! But an entire army? This is just an outpost, so it can't be an entire army.",
    "Still, it must only be an invasion party. The main force is on... well, it doesn't matter right now. I've been doing some research of my own, and I think I know what our next step should be. There's a secret room, deep in the glacier. I think that is where they are making their war plans.",
    "With us, you dolt! They are trying to take over the world. Have you not grasped this yet? You need to find that room. Our future depends on it.",
    "It's probably the most well-guarded room in the place. You'll need to find a way to get into it without arousing suspicion.",
    "What are you doing out here! You need to get in there and find the secret room.",
    "Bards? They have bards?",
    "I'm not even going to ask why. I think dairy cows have bells, you could steal one from it. Bongos... I suppose you could make them? Mahogany is good for bending, and then just use soft leather for the drum.",
    "You're safe! I was really worried for a while there. What happened?",
    "Yes, yes, you're very brave. I mean what happened in the War Room?",
    "But what was IN the War Room?",
    "YES! I knew it! I said I'd prove them all wrong. They are organised and invading. OH YEAH, Larry was right. Who was right? Larry was!",
    "You are such a buzz kill.",
    "No, they only know mine. That agility course really stank up the suit and seems to have covered your scent. You might want to consider bathing soon. As for our next move, I've got... friends... elsewhere who should hear of this information, but we have plenty of time. It's not as though they made a break through in their research or something."

    "... What do you think you are doing?",
    "...So are you. And you are speaking in the common tongue. So, what is your point?",
    "Operatives must not speak without giving the proper greeting. You have not given the proper greeting and until you do I have nothing more to say.",
    "I am sorry, comrade, but you still have not shown me the proper greeting.",
    "Welcome, comrade. Now we may speak properly. What news do you bring? Have you made progress with the main directive?",
    "It was easy?! It was easy to learn how to FLY?",
    "You flapped a lot? I didn't think we could fly like other birds.",
    "This caused you to fly... ingenious.",
    "A hot air balloon? This contraption made you fly?",
    "This is very amazing. I will make note of it in my mission report.",
    "Who cares? It's the entire reason we are in this wretched cage! We need to learn the secret to flight, and the best way is to get these gullible humans to reveal it to us unwittingly. Blast them and their thumbs.",
    "Yes, I am. I'm tired of observing these humans and being gawked at by nasty little children. I miss the fresh codfish of our motherland.",
    "You could take my mission report back to the outpost for me. I don't want to risk breaking out and blowing our cover. You should check in with the operatives in Lumbridge before you head to the outpost. They might have some news for you to take as well.",
    "Yes, comrade?",
    "Do not be so careless again, comrade. What if our reports fell into the wrong hands?",
    "You need to check in with the operatives in Lumbridge before you head to the outpost. They might have some news for you to take as well.",
    "Haa haa haa, that is a funny joke. I like your sense of humour comrade. It would be like asking 'Where is the motherland'.",
    "Haa haa haa... oh you have me in stitches.",
    "Yes, comrade?",
    "So, tell them the phrase. It's not exactly hard to remember. Pescaling Pax has a strange sense of humour.",
    "Pescaling Pax. The Pescallion's son. Well, one of them. He's in charge of research and development at our headquarters.",
    "Comrade! You really do have a funny sense of humour. No, our people live in the great city of Palingrad, of course. Ah, home, I miss it.",
    "If only. The Pescallion has declared that until we have finished our research of the southern species and have developed our great plan, we may not return. So I am stuck here observing humans.",
    "How do you not know the phrase, comrade?",
    "That was very careless of you, comrade. But it is your problem, not mine.",
    "No one left before it was given out. I was one of the first operatives to leave, and I know it.",
    "What? Comrade, I think you need your head examined when you get back.",
    "I see you have some raw cod with you, comrade. I might be willing to exchange information for it, if you are willing.",
    "Thank you comrade. This is like a taste of the motherland. The phrase is 'Do not trust the walrus.'",
    "As you are a comrade, I suppose it is my duty to help you. The phrase is 'Do not trust the walrus.'",
    "I am sorry, comrade, but I cannot break protocol without good reason.",
    "Haa haa haa, that is a funny joke. I like your sense of humour comrade. It would be like asking 'Where is the motherland'.",
    "Haa haa haa... oh you have me in stitches.",
    "Yes, comrade?",
    "What bar? We have a bar? I need a drink.",
    "Good luck with that. Only time I saw those guards leave was to try and arrest those bards.",
    "This is just the entrance hall, nothing is going on. All the research goes on deeper in the 'berg.",
    "Don't lose sight of our goal, comrade. Through fight and flight we shall conquer!",
    "What, ain't you never seen a black and white before?",
    "Sorry, no time. Remember comrade, strength through unity!"
