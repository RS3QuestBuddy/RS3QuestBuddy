  "Ambassador Alvijar": [
    "Headman Ur-tag, I cannot express enough how important it is that this train link be completed on time. The mining companies have taken out considerable loans...",
    "It will be the pinnacle of dwarven engineering! A great leap forward from the old steam-powered minecarts! A monument to the power and ingenuity of the Consortium! And it would be finished by now, except that they found some old goblin bones they want to dig up.",
    "Perhaps now we can get this finished quickly and get on with laying the tracks.",
    "I wish you could work more quickly. The new train link is very important to the dwarven economy.",
    "I hope you're hurrying up with that archaeological dig. Every moment we wait wastes more of the Consortium's money!",
    "Thank you for helping with the dig! Ur-tag tells me it will be finished soon, and then we will be able to resume work!",
    "Thank you for helping with the dig! I hear that the work on the tunnel is now complete and the first train will be making the journey very soon!",
    "What are you babbling about? Everyone was cleared out of the tunnel when we completed work. There's no reason to stop the train."
  ],
  "Ur-tag": [
    "I understand your concerns, Ambassador, but you must realise that the discoveries must change the whole schedule. To remove them too hurriedly would be a crime against knowledge.",
    "It's the new underground train link being built between our city and the dwarven city of Keldagrim.",
    "We've unearthed some very important artefacts that were buried during the Dorgeshuun Civil War. They could shed important light on our history.",
    "[Adventurer], do you have any experience with archaeology?",
    "Excellent! We have not had a major archaeological project for generations, so if you could give us some help we would appreciate it.",
    "Splendid! The path to the train tunnel is in the south-west of the city.",
    "Oh well. We will continue at our own pace.",
    "Why don't you visit the market? I hear there is a quite a craze for surface foods at the moment, so you might be able to sell something there. You might also want to visit the caves to the south of the city. there are many monsters to fight there, and Zanik tells me she has also found ways to cross over their heads!",
    "For trade, and for fostering goodwill between races! I am sure it will benefit both our races.",
    "How is the archaeological dig going?",
    "It is my great pleasure to declare this new train link open! [Adventurer], Zanik has told me about your exploits. It seems that all the Dorgeshuun owe you our lives once again.",
    "As a reward, I suggest you keep the ancient goblin mace that you helped to excavate. Most of the Dorgeshuun would be happy if such a war-like artefact was kept outside the city, and I am sure you will keep it in safe hands."
  ],
  "Player": [
    "What are you talking about?",
    "I passed my archaeology exam at the Digsite!",
    "I'd love to help!",
    "Do your own digging!",
    "What can I do in the city?",
    "Why did you decide to open the city?",
    "It's not finished yet.",
    "Hi Zanik. What are you doing here?",
    "Hi Zanik what are you doing here?",
    "Ur-tag asked me to help out with the dig. I have an archaeological qualification!",
    "Okay.",
    "I haven't got any yet.",
    "I have another one.",
    "I have another one.",
    "I have another one.",
    "I have another one.",
    "I have another one.",
    "I think it's a mace.",
    "A kind of weapon.",
    "Okay",
    "Okay",
    "Yes.",
    "No.",
    "Where is the mace?",
    "Not yet.",
    "It's a mace.",
    "Yes, I talked to the generals in the Goblin Village.",
    "Yes! No we're going to go to the Goblin Village to ask the surface goblins about it!",
    "We're trying to take this ancient goblin mace to the Goblin Village on the surface. Do you think you could help us to get there?",
    "Aaah!",
    "These goblins fight all the time, Zanik. Come on, Warface and Bentnoze are both in the big hut.",
    "Can you tell us anything about this mace?",
    "The Dorgeshuun don't have quite the same attitude to the gods as you on the surface do.",
    "Chosen Commander?",
    "I don't know!",
    "There are two snipers up there.",
    "Sigmund!",
    "Sigmund has kidnapped Zanik!",
    "We don't have time for this! Why don't I take both warriors?",
    "How can I rescue Zanik?",
    "I lost the mace.",
    "Fair enough. Here you go.",
    "No way!",
    "You've got to stop the train! Sigmund is planning something terrible down there!",
    "Yes.",
    "He's probably just gone to get reinforcements. He'll be back in a few moments with more guards.",
    "All in a day's work for an adventurer like me!",
    "Thank you, Ur-tag!"
  ],
  "Zanik": [
    "Hi Player!",
    "I'm having a look at the things that are being dug up here! It's really amazing to think that these things were used by my ancestors hundreds of years ago. Tegdak thinks that some of them may even have been brought down here from the surface by the early Dorgeshuun.",
    "What is it?",
    "Look at the design! That's a lot like the design of the goblin armour I saw on the surface.",
    "What is it?",
    "Look at that stress fracture. It looks like this shield broke pretty easily.",
    "What is it?",
    "A helmet? So those are eye-holes? They look too small.",
    "What is it?",
    "It looks a bit like a sword, doesn't it? I saw some people using them on the surface.",
    "What is it?",
    "Oh, I know what it is! It's a hatchet head! Hatchets are these things they use on the surface for cutting down trees. I think they can be used as weapons too.",
    "What is it?",
    "Sure thing! Come on, [Adventurer], let's go talk to the scribe!",
    "You should pick up your pet thingy first. It would only get in the way.",
    "I've got a strange feeling about this mace, Player. Maybe when we find out about it, it will shed some light onto my destiny. Come on, let's show it to the scribe.",
    "All right. I'll go back and help finish the dig.",
    "Shall we go and talk to the scribe about this ancient mace now?",
    "Let's go then!",
    "Oh well. Let me know when you're ready.",
    "I've got it! I'll hold onto it until we've shown it to the scribe. Shall we go?",
    "Player helped us to finish the dig! Look what [he/she] dug up!",
    "Player says that's a kind of weapon.",
    "We think it's a magical weapon from the surface. Can you decipher the symbols on it?",
    "Oh well.",
    "Good idea! I'd rather not travel all that way over the surface, though. I wonder if Oldak could use magic to help us get there?",
    "Not yet. Come on, Player! We should go and ask the goblin generals about it!",
    "I can't believe we're going to the Goblin Village on the surface! I'm finally going to see how my distant relatives live! Actually, I'm a little nervous about what I'll find there...",
    "Shall we go see Oldak now? I'm sure he'll have a way of getting us to the Goblin Village quickly!",
    "Not right now, Oldak. We wanted to see if you could make Moving-Over-Distance Spheres to somewhere other than the city.",
    "Thanks Oldak! Okay, [Adventurer], let's go!",
    "Ow, my eyes... So this is the Goblin Village! It's so different from Dorgesh-Kaan, isn't it, [Adventurer]? [Adventurer], where are you? [Adventurer]?",
    "Sorry about that, [Adventurer]! Oldak's calculations aren't always exact!",
    "So this is how goblins on the surface live! Come on, Player, lets talk to them!",
    "Hello?",
    "I'm Zanik of the Dorgeshuun!",
    "Yes! We're another tribe of goblins who live underground. We've been cut off from the surface for generations but now we're back.",
    "Who is in charge here?",
    "Hello?",
    "I'm Zanik of the Dorgeshuun!",
    "That's right! We've been cut off from the outside world for thousands of years but now we're back!",
    "Oh. A holy mace of the War God.",
    "I am a goblin!",
    "My destiny...",
    "No, I-",
    "Help, [Adventurer]! What should I say?",
    "Goblins... goblins of the Goblin Village. I'm Zanik of the Dorgeshuun. You may know the legend of the Dorgeshuun, but let me tell you our own version. Thousands of years ago, the Big High War God forced all goblins to fight in a terrible war.",
    "No! Listen! The god commanded the Dorgeshuun to fight a battle they could not win!",
    "You don't need to think in those terms! We've lived for centuries without warm and without gods, and-",
    "The shots came from the top of that tower, [Adventurer]! Can you see anything?",
    "I can't get anywhere without coming into their line of fire, but I think you could get around the side of the buildings to the ladder.",
    "You... you murderer! Quick, [Adventurer]! Shoot him while I have him distracted!",
    "Aaaaah! My eyes!",
    "You monster!",
    "Help! Help!",
    "Quick, [Adventurer]! Untie me before the train comes!"
  ],
  "Builder": [
    "Will you tell those goblins to get on with their digging? We've got a job to finish here.",
    "I hope the Consortium will understand it's not our fault the work will be finished late. This is the most important job of my career!",
    "I'm looking forward to riding on this train once it's finished. It'll be so much faster than the old steam-powered minecarts. It'll be the fastest machine in Gielinor.!",
    "I hope those goblins hurry up with their digging. It's so frustrating having to stop work when the train link is nearly finished!",
    "Bah! These goblins don't appreciate how important this train link is! It'll be the greatest dwarven achievement of this generation, and it's being held up just so they can pick at old broken things in the ground."
  ],
  "Tegdak": [
    "Oh, hello surface-dweller. I'm afraid we're a bit busy cleaning specimens at the moment so I can't help you.",
    "Oh! In that case we could use your help. There are some ancient goblin artefacts buried in the ground around here. We want to extract them, but we don't have much experience and could end up breaking them. Could you extract them, clean them, and then give them to me please?",
    "Here, take this trowel and specimen brush.",
    "How are you getting on with extracting the artefacts?",
    "What? No, extract the artefacts please.",
    "Thanks for extracting that artefact, but you'll need to clean it as well.",
    "Thank you, Player",
    "It looks like a fragment of armour.",
    "That confirms that our ancestors retained a lot of customs from the surface even after they came down here. Our guards didn't start wearing lighter chainmail until after the Civil War.",
    "It looks like a piece of a shield.",
    "I would guess that this shield was made during the Dorgeshuun Civil War and not handed down from the time on the surface. It seems that even by the time of the Civil War, our ancestors were beginning to lose their skills at making weapons.",
    "It looks like a piece of a helmet.",
    "This was from the early days of Dorgesh-Kaan. It must have been before our ancestors' eyes reached their current size.",
    "I'm not sure. What do you think?",
    "The early Dorgeshuun must have used a much larger variety of weapons than we do now.",
    "I'm not sure. It's got some kind of blade... Is it a spear tip?",
    "Our ancestors must have brought it down from the surface, then. There would be no need for them to make hatchets when they were down here, as there are no trees. It's amazing to think that we're handling objects that date back to the time of the war of the gods!",
    "It's... Actually, what is it? It's a sort of stick with a lump on the end.",
    "A mace?",
    "That's all the artefacts we needed to extract. Thanks again, [Adventurer]! Now, the most interesting one is this ancient mace. It's the only intact weapon, and I'm pretty sure it dates back to the time when the Dorgeshuun were on the surface. It's covered in symbols, but I can't decipher them. Zanik, could you take it to the scribe? He might know what they mean. I'll finish up the dig here.",
    "Thanks for your help. There's not much left for us to do here except pack everything up. Have you shown that mace to the scribe yet?",
    "Thanks for your help. There's not much left for us to do here except pack everything up. Have you shown that mace to the scribe yet?",
    "Good idea! Maybe Oldak can help you get there."
  ],
  "Goblin scribe": [
    "Ah, hello Zanik, hello Player. How is the dig going?",
    "Hmm... that is interesting. What do you think it is?",
    "I can see how. I certainly wouldn't want to be hit with it!",
    "Hmm... No. I'm afraid not. Our written language has developed so much since then that it's totally indecipherable to me.",
    "Wait a moment. [Player], didn't you say you talked to some surface goblins when you were trying to find your way through to our mines?",
    "Perhaps you could talk to them again. They might know more about weapons than we do.",
    "Hello, Zanik. Have you found out about that mace yet?"
  ],
  "Oldak": [
    "Ah, Zanik. Would you like to see the results of my experiment with nature runes?",
    "Oh yes. My research along those lines has been coming along very well. I think I could make a Moving-Over-Distance Sphere to anywhere you like, given a little work.",
    "Hmm. The Goblin Village, you say? I think I could do that. Just a moment.",
    "There you go. I've made you each one to get you to the Goblin Village and one to bring you back here."

  "Goblin #1": [
    "Who you?",
    "Dorgeshuun?",
    "What you want?",

    "No let him speak.",
    "That story from goblin holy book. We not had Commander of all goblins since time of great war. Holy book say someday Big High War God send Chosen Commander to lead us to victory over whole world.",
    "But what if she is? If we ignore her, Big High War God strike us down!",
    "Grubfoot! Tell people in village to gather around! Dorgesh goblin will speak to us all!",

    "We know! Some goblin find it, give it back here.",

    "You should praise Big High War God for giving you holy mace!",
    "You not real goblin! You filthy human!",
    "You not even look like goblin! You have big eyes and wrong colour skin!",
    "Shut up Grubfoot!",

    "We under attack!",
    "What happen?",
    "Human will need help. You take our best warrior, Sergeant Mossfists.",
    "Okay. Grubfoot! Fetch Mossfists and Slimetoes and tell them to meet [Adventurer] in Lumbridge Swamp! You take ancient goblin mace. Maybe it be useful.",

I'm taking her to the tunnel we've built from the Lumbridge Swamp Caves to the new dwarven train track. When the cave goblins find that the dwarven train has killed their hero, there will be war between them! Saradomin's chosen children can watch as two vile underground races wipe each other out! A-ha-ha-ha-ha-haaa!",
    "At last I have defeated you, filthy goblin! Any moment now the first dwarf train will come thundering down this tunnel and crush you! And then the goblins and the dwarves will go to war! Ha ha ha ha ha!",
    "No, YOU'RE the monster! That's why you and all your filthy species must die!",
