    "I'm Xenia. We met in Lumbridge, when you were rescuing a woman from some cultists in the catacombs.",
    "Ceril Carnillean wants his son, Philipe, to become an adventurer like we are. He tried to hire me as a tutor for the boy. I refused, on the grounds that I would never work for that windbag, so I recommended you instead. After all, you did such a good job in the Lumbridge catacombs.",
    "And I hope you'll act more responsibly in the future! Fortunately, Ceril doesn't know the truth. I told him that you saved his family from the cultists. He believes that he'll be in danger if he learns the secret of the cult, so he won't ask any awkward questions.",
    "You're welcome.  So, will you take the job?",
    "You're the right person for this job, so it had to be done. Will you accept?",
    "Yes, he remembers you. So, will you take the job?",
    "That's a shame; I really think you're the right person for the job. I shall keep the offer open.",
    "Excellent. Go and see Lord Carnillean for your instructions. I wish you all the best.",
    "Ceril Carnillean still wants you to train his son as an adventurer. Will you take the job?",
    "How did Philipe get on with the Cave Wolf Matriarch?",
    "When Ceril first offered me the job, I explored the cave and found her with her pups. Ceril's quest was completely ridiculous - stylised romantic rubbish and entirely safe. Philipe would only learn to be an adventurer if he were faced with a real threat. I stunned the Matriarch and buried her under a pile of rubble, so that she could emerge while Philipe was doing the quest. The ruse seems to have worked, from what I see. Philipe fought the Matriarch and found a little self-respect.",
    "Stop fretting. You were there to save the day if Philipe turned out to be useless.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I wanted Philipe to come face-to-face with the unexpected. If he'd known about the Cave Wolf Matriarch, it wouldn't have been the same at all.",
    "Philipe has grown from a spoilt brat into a hero. Claim your payment from Ceril; you've earned it."

    "He hired me before, to retrieve some armour that had been stolen by cultists. I found that his own butler was part of the plot.",
    "Xenia mentioned something you needed doing.",
    "Yes. I haven't given her an answer yet.",
    "I haven't agreed to do it yet.",

    "Sure, sure.",

    "I'd like you to walk back and forth in the cave, so that Philipe can sneak past you.",
    "I'd like you to guard the cave. Philipe will bring you a drink, you get drunk and pass out.",
    "Okay, I'll make sure Philipe brings the right wine. So, do we have a deal?",
    "I'd like you to pretend you're a dragon. Philipe will come along and slay you.",
    "...alright, I'll offer you a different job.",
    "I'd like you to be the damsel in distress.",
    "I'll tie you up, and Philipe can rescue you. Then you... uh... embrace him.",
    "Perhaps you could help. I need a damsel in distress for Philipe to rescue.",
    "Construction is in progress.",
    "So, if you like acting, would you want a part in the drama I'm directing?",
    "You'll be a guard, patrolling your base to watch for marauders.",
    "You'll be a lazy guard who gets drunk and passes out on the job.",
    "You'll be a dragon.",
    "No, you're a dragon, and you get killed.",
    "You'll be a damsel in distress, held in a cave. A hero will slay the dragons, untie you and carry you out to safety.",

    "No, I just want you to patrol the corridor and shout if you see him.",
    "I want you to guard the bridge. A boy will come and offer you some wine. Drink it and pass out.",
    "I want you to pretend you're dragons, so that a boy can come slay you.",
    "That would, indeed, be what the job requires.",
    "I want you to be a damsel in distress. I'll tie you up, and, when a boy rescues you, I want you to embrace him.",
    "It'll come.",
    "Hold on to it, please.",
    "Okay, this is where you're supposed to be tied up.",
    "I haven't got anything with which to tie you up.",
    "Actually, it's a prop. When your hero rescues you, you can give it to him in thanks.",
    "Hey, Philipe...",
    "Please listen, brave adventurer. An innocent girl is being held prisoner in a cave, deep below Ardougne. Will you take up arms and rescue her?",
    "Oh. Will you do the quest anyway?",
    "It's not pointless. Listen...",
    "Let me talk to you about that quest again.",
    "I...do not have your sweets.",
    "Come on, climb over the ledge. It's not that hard.",
    "Quiet now, there are some guards here. You've got to sneak past them.",
    "Just sneak past them, okay?",
    "Um, I'd better go and get the guards to adjust their patrol slightly.",

    "No, please stop for a moment.",
    "...",
    "Wait a moment, I need to talk to you.",
    "Thanks, that was very helpful. You two can stop patrolling now.",
    "Well done getting past the goblins.",
    "Don't you have anything on your toolbelt?",
    "This should help you cut through the tripwire.",
    "There's a guard at the bridge.  You've got to disguise yourself so you can approach and get him drunk.",
    "Oh, right, I see.  Well, he'll see you and sound the alarm.",
    "There'll be combat soon enough. Now, you need a disguise and some of your father's fortified wine.",
    "Here's your disguise.",
    "Your father suggested it.  If the guard recognizes you, he won't accept the drink.",
    "This isn't part of the quest! Get away from that thing!",
    "Philipe has completed the quest! He defeated a Cave Wolf Matriarch!",
    "It wasn't there when I set up the dungeon...",
    "You knew about the Matriarch? Why didn't you tell me?",
    "Speaking of Philipe, where is he now?",

    "Bah! Opportunities like this don't come along every day. Go tell her that you will do the job I gave her.",
    "Good. That dratted Xenia woman took the job, poked around my cellar, then said she was too busy! The old bat is obviously losing her marbles. She kept forgetting to address me as 'Sir'.",
    "Henryeta and I have been concerned about the lad for a while now. We're not getting any younger, you know, and it will soon be Philipe's turn to represent the noble Carnillean family. Thing is, the lad just hasn't got the spark. He doesn't take the blindest bit of interest in anything beyond the next meal. Henryeta and I hired tutors to teach him natural philosophy, sports, art - everything. He just isn't interested. We thought Philipe would buck his ideas up if he had a girl to impress, so we invited a friend's daughter to stay here. Sarsaparilla's a good match for Philipe: very good bloodline. But Philipe claims she's boring, and she's hardly happy with him either.",
    "If Philipe can pass himself off as an adventurer, he'll be respected in the king's court. So, I want you to create a quest for him.",
    "These quest things are all the same, aren't they? I know how they work. Creep through cobwebs, perform a death-defying stunt, sneak past guards, disable fiendish traps... Disguise yourself as a humble maid to get a jail guard drunk, slay some dragons, untie the damsel in distress and return home loaded with riches! The cellar wall collapsed recently, and we found a passage leading into a cave. I'm sure you can create the quest down there.",
    "Use anything from the mansion, but don't bring your own supplies. If I let you bring materials in, you'll expect to be reimbursed later. I'm not having that. Crichton, the butler, knows what I expect. He will supervise your work. Go and meet him now.",
    "Create a quest for Philipe in the cave beneath my cellar. The butler knows what I expect. He will supervise your work.",
    "What? How dare you suggest we've neglected the boy! I'll have you know that he's wanted for nothing. All his life, he's had the best nursemaids, servants and tutors that my money can buy.",

    "So, get on with it!",

    "I see you've returned. How was it, Philipe?  Do you feel like an adventurer?",
    "What's this?  I didn't say anything about a wolf. Why was there a wolf in my quest?",
    "A Cave Wolf Matriarch, eh?  That's...most impressive. Jolly good show. Jolly good show indeed.",
    "Bah!  It's that adventuring woman again. We don't need her anymore.",
    "You, go get rid of her. I want some quality time with my son now. I need to tell him how proud I am of him.",
    "Adventurer, I cannot thank you enough. You've completely transformed my son.",
    "Philipe's left home; he said he 'wanted more adventures'. Couldn't be more proud of him. You have certainly earned your reward. I've had Crichton set out your reward in the chest, just here. Philipe's left something for you too. Search the chest to claim it all."

    "Butler Jones? He quit his job and left. Said his 'work here was complete', whatever that means. Weird chap.",

There's a ledge he could climb across. There's a nice junction here for guards to patrol. Gah! A goblin camp.  Goblins get everywhere. The arches are supported by flimsy struts. You could set a trap here. Huh. It sounds like there are creatures living in here. Smells like it too. Get someone to guard here and the kid can get 'em drunk. This area would be a grand place to put the damsel in distress, guarded by some dragons.",
    "Oh, Ceril may have no idea what he's doing, he gets things right occasionally. Law of averages, y'know. Now, let's get to work!",
    "What's up?",
    "Let me think... No, there's more work to be done.",
    "Well, you could look for fabric that might be arranged to look like a cobweb over the entrance to the cave.",
    "Perhaps you could arrange that netting to look like a cobweb over the entrance to the cave. It wouldn't fool a fly, but it might fool the brat.",
    "You've already put up a pretty nice cobweb, mate.",
    "There's a narrow ledge just inside the cave. Stick an obstacle beneath it and the kid will have to climb across.",
    "Now you've got your pool of water, the brat will have to climb across on the narrow ledge.",
    "Now you've got your pit of spikes, the brat will have to climb across on the narrow ledge.",
    "There are two goblins in the cave. I'm sure you can persuade them to do the job.",
    "Those two goblins seem willing. Give them Ceril's old heraldic kit; he's too fat to wear it, anyway.",
    "You've got those two goblins, ready to patrol.",
    "Have a look at the crumbling arches where the goblins live. I bet some tripwires would make 'em fall down on the brat's head, if he isn't careful.",
    "You've set up a nifty pair of tripwire traps.  They should bring the arches down on the brat's head.",
    "We need a volunteer who'll get drunk. Claus, the chef, is always up for a drink.",
    "You'd better lead Claus to where he needs to wait.",
    "You've got Claus in position. Make sure you've got a disguise for the brat.",

    "You've led some wolves to the right place. Now, disguise them as dragons with the stuffed heads you found.",
    "That's one dragon sorted. Dress up the other one and we're done.",

    "There are only two women in the house. See if you can get one of them to help.",
    "I'd get Miss Snotty-nose down to the cave. If I were you, I'd leave her there.",
    "You've got Miss Snotty-nose tied up in the cave. If I were you, I'd leave her there.",
    "You'll need to place something valuable in the dungeon where the brat will find it.",
    "The brat could loot the guard once he's drunk. Or the distressed damsel could hand him some jewellery.",
    "Perhaps you could give the money pouch to the jail guard. The brat can loot him once he's passed out.",
    "Perhaps you could give the necklace to the distressed damsel. She can hand it to him as his reward.",
    "You've given Claus a bag of money. The brat can loot it from him.",
    "You've given Miss Snotty-nose a shiny necklace. She can 'bestow it on her gallant saviour' when he rescues her.",
    "Look out for places where you can build decorations in the cave. Try to make 'em scary; I want to see the brat squeal.",

    "You've put up three decorations. That's plenty.",
    "Okay.",
    "Okay, follow me.",
    "Okay.",
