  "Azzanadra": [
    "Player, come over here. We should speak.",
    "World Guardian, good.",
    "Armadyl, Icthlarin and I are concerned by the level of influence Seren is exerting over this council.",
    "Shall we see how it goes this time?",
    "This again?",
    "I was not always Azzanadra, your trusted friend.",
    "Six thousand years ago I was Azzanadra, Pontifex Maximus of the Zarosian Empire.",
    "I maintained civilisation and the rule of my lord against all those who called themselves gods.",
    "I am very familiar with Seren's influence.",
    "We can no longer rely on this council.",
    "They are completely under her sway now.",
    "In time they will recover their initiative, but for now they are nothing but puppets.",
    "Disappointing, but not unexpected.",
    "Seren is obsessed with the adult elder gods.",
    "Her guilt and shame blind her to the true threat.",
    "It is not the adults who are destined to destroy us. It is their unborn children.",
    "If they wake, they will devour this world, and in time, all worlds.",
    "If the best these fools can do is waste their time on senseless appeasement, then it falls to us to save them.",
    "We must find the elder god eggs.",
    "We must stop them hatching.",
    "It's been nearly seven thousand years, psychopompus. Surely the good of this world outweighs the events of the distant past.",
    "You speak of loyalty as if it were a vice. Loyalty is the highest - perhaps the only - virtue.",
    "It is not for creatures such as us to question the morality of a true god.",
    "His thoughts are beyond our comprehension. He is a higher power.",
    "...",
    "As you wish. World Guardian, I assume you do want to help?",
    "Meet me inside the dig site in Kharid-et. Since no one here is of use, we will find our own allies.",
    "Meet me inside the digsite in Kharid-et. Since no one here is of use, we will find our own allies.",
    "Was your debriefing completed to our Lord's satisfaction?",
    "What did he want to know?",
    "Ah, Player. You've already met Trindine, of course.",
    "Seren is obsessed with the adult elder gods.",
    "She is still wracked with guilt over murdering her - and our - creator, and trying to appease the others is her way of seeking amends.",
    "But it is not the adult elders that pose the real danger.",
    "Their offspring are the true threat. Piecing together Seren's and Kerapac's claims, there must be three eggs on Gielinor.",
    "Mah never laid an egg, and Jas sacrificed hers to create the Stone of Jas, which has since been destroyed.",
    "If the three remaining eggs hatch, they will destroy our world and, in turn, the universe.",
    "It seems to me to follow, then, that our efforts should be focused not on the adults, but on the eggs.",
    "When my Lord returned to us a few years ago, he gave me the task of locating those very same eggs.",
    "I can only assume he foresaw our current situation.",
    "I am ashamed to say that I have not yet succeeded in that task. With your help, we will correct that oversight.",
    "We need to find the eggs.",
    "Once we find them, with enough information and study we may be able to devise a plan to stave off our annihilation.",
    "You and I will travel to Freneskae and inspect the site of the previous generation of eggs there.",
    "Trindine, a moment. I have other orders for you. Meet me at the world gate, Player. It's in Kandarin, southwest of the Tree Gnome Stronghold.",
    "Meet me at the world gate, Player. It's in Kandarin, southwest of the Tree Gnome Stronghold.",
    "We need to make our way across the surface of Freneskae back to the Elder Halls.",
    "If we want to understand the elder gods and their eggs, it's the most obvious lead to research in more detail.",
    "With Mah's death the constant destabilisation of this region has calmed somewhat.",
    "It is strange to see it so peaceful.",
    "Compared to what it was when it shaped us and hardened us, yes, I would call this peaceful.",
    "I will see you up ahead.",
    "You could be faster.",
    "We can pause for moment.",
    "Teleporting others is extremely difficult.",
    "Only gods can do it easily, and even then it requires vast reserves of power.",
    "That sort of spell only teleports to a specific location. Teleporting to arbitrary points is much more difficult.",
    "Let's move on.",
    "Who told you that?",
    "That explains it. What use would the followers of the true god have for a creation of a pretender like Guthix? And the less said about Icthlarin, the better.",
    "Of course. Every stabilising religion needs to answer that question.",
    "We call it Erebus.",
    "I have no idea. It's the afterlife - no one has ever returned to speak of it.",
    "It is not the way of our lord to invent false narratives to appeal to the plebeians.",
    "Obviously none of this applies to Mahjarrat, as we do not have souls.",
    "But when a mortal of the faithful dies, their soul passes on from this world to another.",
    "Those attuned to the currents of magic can sense its passing, but we do not know the destination. We call that unknown place 'Erebus'.",
    "Let's move on.",
    "It is necessary for his plans somehow.",
    "He did not tell me. It was not something I needed to know.",
    "Whether I am the most loyal, I cannot say.",
    "For hundreds of years I served his will to the best of my ability.",
    "The title of Pontifex Maximus seems pretentious now that there is no church and no empire, but it is technically still accurate.",
    "You speak of Zaros as though he were a friend, an ally.",
    "Of course not. Zaros is a god. With him lies all authority. If I need to know something, I will be told it.",
    "Let's move on.",
    "Do you need another rest?",
    "We are almost there.",
    "I do not think we are in imminent danger, but we should not waste time.",
    "The Elder Halls of Freneskae are just up ahead.",
    "Player, someone is in here.",
    "Are you going to introduce me to your friend?",
    "What have you been able to determine so far?",
    "She was recently put out of her misery.",
    "One lies at the end of each of the tunnels.",
    "My people came to Gielinor around seven thousand years ago.",
    "I lived here on Freneskae for hundreds of years prior to that.",
    "Life was a lot harder here than on Gielinor, even accounting for the god wars.",
    "Living to several hundred years old was unusual, and I was one of the oldest and strongest of my tribe.",
    "To answer your first question, yes, or at least it has looked like this for as long as I have been alive, and as long as anyone I knew had been.",
    "This is just what Freneskae had always been like.",
    "Whether it looked different in some prior age, I cannot say.",
    "Mah was deformed. It is why her sisters abandoned her here.",
    "Can you imagine a more wretched form to be trapped in?",
    "That was a joke.",
    "Never mind.",
    "The elder gods are true gods, like my lord. I do not believe they can be so readily categorised.",
    "They may have superficial aesthetic qualities, but that does not define them or limit them.",
    "They are gods. They are beyond our comprehension.",
    "This was not Wen's doing.",
    "Magical energy has a resonance. A... flavour, if you will, or a smell.",
    "This whole place is suffused with Mah's resonance. A resonance that I - and all Mahjarrat - share with her.",
    "Mahjarrat are beings of magic. We are attuned to it, just as you can smell meat.",
    "There is another resonance on this egg, but it is not Wen's.",
    "In fact, it reminds me of- remember Zemouregal?",
    "He had a black stone he used for necromancy. He said he found it in Karamja and the fool thought it was obsidian.",
    "It was cold to the touch. Freezing, in fact, and it shared the same resonance as this corruption...",
    "But Mah is dead now, and poses no threat to Gielinor. This is a mystery for another time.",
    "Jas made a tremendous sacrifice when she gave up her unborn offspring.",
    "Do not confuse the primitive instincts of mere mortals with the thoughts of gods.",
    "You place great significance in your atavistic impulses. Your urges drive you to behaviours, and you never stop to question them.",
    "The Stone had long ago served its purpose. I doubt it had more significance to Jas than any other tool.",
    "I value all Mahjarrat. Those I had a hand in the creation of and those I didn't matter equally to me.",
    "Besides, the reserves of power in the Stone of Jas were not limitless.",
    "No. I have never touched it, I am no fool, but I have been in its presence many times over the millennia, close enough to sense it clearly.",
    "At the height of the empire it contained far more magical energy than it did when Lucien possessed it.",
    "Some time ago, I obtained a device that could be of use here from a construct of Jas.",
    "A blank observation crystal. Here, take it.",
    "This item is a relic of the creators of the universe. Be more careful with it.",
    "My research suggests that the observation crystal should function somewhat like an engrammeter.",
    "Traces of memories from the birth of the elder gods still linger in this cavern.",
    "If you can collect enough of it, perhaps we can sift through it for memories of that event.",
    "We should try.",
    "A blank observation crystal. I believe I gave it to you.",
    "This item is a relic of the creators of the universe. Be more careful with it.",
    "Collect memories from the wisps in the cavern so that we can search them for anything useful.",
    "You seem to have misplaced the blank observation.",
    "Make some inventory space and I can give it back to you.",
    "Collect memories from the wisps in the cavern so that we can search them for anything useful.",
    "Once you have enough memories, you should investigate the blank observation.",
    "I believe it should be able to absorb the memories.",
    "Research suggest is[sic] works like an engrammeter.",
    "Good. Give it to me.",
    "Nothing. Strange. Perhaps the memories are too faded.",
    "As we suspected, the hatchlings are the true threat.",
    "If we could stop the adults from touching their eggs, that could prevent them from hatching.",
    "Of course not, but do you have a better idea?",
    "We will have to build that bridge when we come to the river.",
    "For now we must at least locate the eggs.",
    "I anticipated this. That's why I sent Trindine on to Falador ahead of us.",
    "Saradomin's most prized possession is a crown which can locate elder artefacts.",
    "Possibly. It is an avenue I have not been able to pursue.",
    "He has not been seen on Gielinor for some time. You will have to try to contact him somehow.",
    "World Guardian, find Trindine in Falador. Impress the importance of your task upon Saradomin's lackeys and they can summon him.",
    "I cannot accompany you. My presence will not be of use when dealing with Saradominists.",
    "Ariane, your resourcefulness could be an asset in this matter. If you wish to continue down this path, meet me inside the dig site near Al Kharid.",
    "This will have to wait. Player, Trindine, were you successful?",
    "Who is this?",
    "A Saradominist?",
    "Ideally, yes. Right now we are trying to find the eggs.",
    "Yes.",
    "Then we will put you to use.",
    "The crown was a potential opportunity, but not the only one.",
    "We must pursue every lead we have.",
    "I have been drawing up a list of possible avenues of investigation.",
    "The most obvious are those most directly connected with the elder gods, mouthpieces known as the Kra.",
    "I have had dealings with them in the past. Ariane and I will interrogate them. Perhaps we can be more persuasive this time.",
    "Player, you will take Trindine to investigate three other potential leads.",
    "The TokHaar, Guthix and the Saradominist wizards.",
    "Indeed. However, my understanding is that he left many memories, some of which are still being discovered.",
    "Enough. We have tasks to do.",
    "Do you have any suggestions to offer?",
    "Then you have your assignment. Unearth Sir Vey Lance and acquire any information he may have on the eggs, or the elder gods in general.",
    "We will meet back here and discuss anything we turn up.",
    "Owen has not returned yet. Ariane is still recovering from our mission.",
    "The Kra would not relinquish their information to us, so we devised an alternative.",
    "We destroyed all four of them and rendered their cores into a gaseous concoction, which Ariane then inhaled.",
    "The plan was largely of her devising.",
    "She has yet to recover consciousness. What of your efforts?",
    "Where?",
    "That was the first place I looked. They are not there.",
    "Trindine, you find Sir Owen. The rest of us will go to the Heart of Gielinor and finish this.",
    "Things have changed here.",
    "The Heart was no longer necessary to my lord's designs, so our forces withdrew.",
    "I understand Zamorak also withdrew for reasons of his own, and Sliske's army crumbled and fled.",
    "Only the elves and that obscenity Gregorovic remain now.",
    "Be wary.",
    "Believe it or not, we come in peace.",
    "I don't have time for this. Stand aside, elf, or I will do what I must.",
    "I have faced armies greater than this and triumphed.",
    "A fortunate coincidence.",
    "You are right. With enemies as chaotic as ours, such openings are bound to occur.",
    "Where next?",
    "A secret door? How quaint.",
    "We must ascertain their status, and quickly.",
    "Another pressing matter demands my attention, yes, but first we must check on each of the eggs.",
    "We should hurry.",
    "Not with anything we have with us.",
    "The inside of these spheres is a thick soup of anima, more concentrated than anything I've ever felt before.",
    "The divine flesh of false gods such as Zamorak is so resilient that only a handful of things in this universe can damage them.",
    "It feels like... we should check another.",
    "It is the same with this one as the last.",
    "They are not completely asleep, or perhaps they sleep fitfully.",
    "...",
    "No, although the quantity would be trace at best, and this is not my area of expertise.",
    "Excuse me?",
    "Aurally yes, although the magical vibrations of the eggs are verging on painful to my senses.",
    "Let us check the last egg before we leave.",
    "And slightly disturbed, indeed.",
    "I cannot say for sure, but comparing this scene with what we witnessed on Freneskae, I would say not.",
    "The concentration of anima within, although incredibly high, is not overflowing in the same way we saw in the vision.",
    "This is all speculation. Based on what we've seen, perhaps.",
    "The death of a god or the destruction of an elder artefact would release a blast of energy.",
    "That would be my recommendation.",
    "For now, nothing. As I said, other matters demand my attention.",
    "The eggs are here, and they are secure.",
    "You may remain here and study them if you wish, though we should probably avoid making their location known.",
    "Zamorak or Saradomin would surely try to steal the power for themselves.",
    "Knowledge is power, is it not? We know more than we did before.",
    "Regardless, I have spent enough time here. I must report to my lord.",
    "What? He still has the crown?",
    "You've lost, Saradomin.",
    "Without your crown, you are powerless against servants of the true Lord.",
    "My Lord has commanded me. I will die before I fail.",
    "I apologise, Lord. Our intelligence was lacking.",
    "Of course, my Lord.",
    "Yes, my Lord. What of the eggs?",
    "Yes, Lord. They will destroy Gielinor.",
    "Yes, my Lord.",
    "Player. I am grateful for your assistance in this matter.",
    "My apologies, Player, but I have never been less than honest with my priorities. I did as my Lord commanded me to the best of my abilities.",
    "Perhaps you seek revenge. This is not the time to find it.",
    "My Lord's judgement told me otherwise.",
    "You have been of great use to us, but he does not trust your allegiances.",
    "You owe too much to the memory of Guthix, and to Gielinor, and to the many masters you have served, to be beyond question.",
    "I'm sure you have many questions. We have much to attend to, however.",
    "Since we first met I have valued not only your practical use, but also your companionship.",
    "But you have your responsibilities and I have mine.",
    "I will see you at the Monolith.",
    "When next we meet, it will be as enemies."

  "Seren": [
    "Once more, I have summoned the Burthorpe Council to discuss the very real threat of the elder gods.",
    "No, that isn't what I-",
    "...",
    "Very well. Since Kerapac's plot was little short of genocide, we will resume my original plan and attempt to placate my aunts through the creation of a garden."

    "Yes! You must save us, Lady Seren! Tell us what to do!"

    "Do what you must, but I will remain with the council and aid in their efforts."
  ],
  "Player": [
    "Do you know a lot about how Seren's aura works?",
    "What did you have in mind?",
    "You're not Azzanadra? Who are you then?",
    "Wahisietel?",
    "Er, okay. So where is Azzanadra?",
    "How are you feeling?",
    "I'm with you so far.",
    "Alright. What's our first move?",
    "You think this is peaceful? It's a volcanic wasteland!",
    "*cough*",
    "Some of us can't just teleport everywhere.",
    "I know tele-other. It's easy to cast.",
    "I think it was Death and Icthlarin. Death said he knows of no Zarosian afterlife, and Icthlarin said he's never escorted anyone there.",
    "Are you saying Zarosians do have an afterlife?",
    "What's it like?",
    "You must have stories. Religious legends.",
    "Then how do you know it even exists?",
    "Fascinating.",
    "Somehow? You mean you don't know?",
    "I thought you were his most loyal follower.",
    "How can you place so much trust in someone that doesn't trust you?",
    "Isn't he?",
    "It's me, Player.",
    "Stop! That's Azzanadra.",
    "Yeah, we go way back.",
    "That's why we're here too!",
    "Yes! That's what we thought too!",
    "The fifth god, Mah, never left Freneskae.",
    "We think there are actually only three eggs on Gielinor. Jas transformed her egg into the Stone of Jas, and Kerapac destroyed it.",
    "I've never seen a wisp like this before. I probably shouldn't disturb it at the moment.",
    "Is there any way we can tell what happened?",
    "Has Freneskae always looked like this?",
    "Only hundreds of years? I thought you might be older.",
    "The eggs are all the same shape.",
    "I suppose, but I've met Jas and I've met Mah and they were very much unlike each other. Hard to believe they're the same kind of beings.",
    "Oh, it was a while ago now. You remember Sliske was trying to get the gods to kill each other?",
    "Well after he died I met Jas. Apparently he was working for her, or pretending to, or something.",
    "Cryptic. I didn't really learn anything.",
    "Well, Jas mostly looked like a huge clock or something, and Mah looked more like a humanoid. Scarred and deformed, but definitely humanoid.",
    "Where?",
    "That sounds a bit like Ful. She appeared briefly over Anachronia.",
    "Maybe. I suppose she could have had a body somewhere back there.",
    "What about Mah, though?",
    "Deformed into a humanoid?",
    "I'm sorry, what?",
    "I don't get it.",
    "Aren't they supposed to be different aspects of time? Change, stasis, undoing, something like that? I'm sure I read that somewhere.",
    "This was Mah's egg. Something happened to it and she was born deformed and insensible.",
    "Wen has an association with ice. Why would Wen sabotage Mah's egg?",
    "It really does look like the Stone of Jas, doesn't it?",
    "It's weird that she didn't seem angrier with Kerapac for destroying the Stone.",
    "You're saying that a tool made out of your own children wouldn't matter to you?",
    "They weren't?",
    "We know everything we need to from this sphere.",
    "That's all of the eggs. I should check in with Azzanadra and Ariane.",
    "There's no obvious sign of what happened when the eggs hatched.",
    "Well yes, but there's no clear order of events. Did the hatchlings destroy the planet?",
    "Yes, exactly. These clues are thousands, maybe millions of years old, though.",
    "Will that even work?",
    "Oh, this thing? Yeah I thought it might come in handy so I brought it along.",
    "Oh, that thing. I think I dropped it.",
    "I don't need any more of this energy.",
    "Nothing happened... I think I must need more energy.",
    "I think I have enough of these memories.",
    "I should show this to Azzanadra and Ariane.",
    "The blank observation absorbed the memories I collected.",
    "What?",
    "...",
    "What have we actually learned that's useful though? We already knew they were dangerous.",
    "We still don't know where they are or how to stop them.",
    "Are you sure?",
    "I suppose not.",
    "We're no closer than when we started.",
    "And you think it might be able to locate the eggs?",
    "Hello? Who's there?",
    "So you don't know?",
    "I can't hear you.",
    "Okay, I can hear you, but I won't.",
    "I've heard enough. I have a world to save.",
    "I'm not okay with this.",
    "Can I help you?",
    "Who are you meant to be?",
    "I see. What now?",
    "You're not worried that he might see through your disguise?",
    "Yes actually, I need to speak to him.",
    "I'm the World Guardian, I need to speak to Saradomin about a matter of great urgency.",
    "But this is urgent, there must be something you can do?",
    "I know what you mean. I'm trying to get an audience with Saradomin and I've been blocked at the first hurdle.",
    "Ooh nothing important, just, you know, how to stop the end of the world.",
    "I'm sure it can wait.",
    "The infant elder gods are waking up and if they hatch they'll kill all life on this planet.",
    "We were hoping to use Saradomin's crown to track down the eggs on Gielinor. But he's not here.",
    "So we need to go and speak to Sir Varze?",
    "We need to talk to Saradomin, in person. The priests won't summon him without your permission.",
    "I need to talk to him about the elder god situation.",
    "Would you be willing to give them a glowing review for Sir Amik Varze?",
    "Why not?",
    "Oh, you know; 'If you could just do me one small favour', that kind of thing.",
    "Always seems to happen when I need to do something urgently.",
    "Like stop the entire world from ending. But no, no, you're right, your petty little issue is clearly so important that we must endanger us all.",
    "No! No I am not! Every time I try and avert some horrifying catastrophe someone always has to give me some mindless little task before I can get there.",
    "Get me better armour! Bake me a cake! Find Mr Flibbles my delightful stuffed crocodile!",
    "Is it really so much to ask that we deal with the immediate problem and then I can come back and deal with the small stuff later as a miniquest or post quest content?",
    "No? FINE! Let's just move on shall we? You can give me your mindless task that will doubtless have more hurdles and then maybe we can not ALL DIE!",
    "Oh go f-",
    "*Sigh* Yes, it's fine. You want better equipment for your knights was it?",
    "Hello.",
    "Do you have a moment to talk about the White Knight recruits?",
    "I want you to give the White Knight recruits new equipment.",
    "I can see where this is going...",
    "There's paperwork.",
    "Nothing useful. Did you find anything?",
    "I've already got what I need from here.",
    "Rats! I can't fit this in my already full backpack. Maybe if I roll it up really tight I can...no let's not go there.",
    "I don't think I need another one.",
    "Silence... I don't know what else I expected.",
    "I need to be near Saradomin's throne before this will do anything.",
    "The elder god threat is much greater than when you were last here.",
    "It's only a matter of time before their eggs hatch and the newborn elder gods consume all the anima on the planet.",
    "We are concerned about Seren and the influence she has over the council.",
    "I am working with Azzanadra. We're worried about the influence Seren is exerting over the council.",
    "Oh, I'm working with Azzanadra, not Zaros.",
    "Finding the eggs is the first step to finding a true solution.",
    "The elder gods need to touch the eggs in order to hatch them. So if we can somehow intervene before then, we can prevent them waking.",
    "Yes. As the crown can track down elder artefacts, surely it can track down the eggs themselves?",
    "Why not join us on this quest? Your help could be invaluable.",
    "Happy to have you along. We should head back to Kharid-et and speak with the others.",
    "Saradomin didn't seem too pleased with you.",
    "We summoned Saradomin, but he wouldn't give us the crown.",
    "The crown was a dead end. What else can we do?",
    "What else is there?",
    "Yes. They were bizarre creatures. Surprisingly opinionated for constructs.",
    "A rebellious faction live under the volcano in Karamja. TzHaar City. We could start there.",
    "We can't ask Guthix though. Guthix is dead.",
    "That's right. There's a large repository of them near Piscatoris.",
    "Yes, Sir Vey Lance. Supposedly he gets his orders directly from Saradomin.",
    "Isn't that the whole hierarchy anyway?",
    "Oh yes, in TzHaar City under the volcano in Karamja.",
    "South of Draynor, right.",
    "Yeah near Piscatoris.",
    "Under the pool there's another chamber. It's full of automatons and memories.",
    "Wait!",
    "Emergency... uh... override!",
    "Wait! Emergency override!",
    "Wait! Emergency override!",
    "Memory... uh... core... uh...",
    "Core dump! Dump memory? Dump core memory!",
    "We need to access anything Guthix might know about the elder gods.",
    "This is Trindine. When I restore your memories, don't flag her as an intruder.",
    "I think they're the Archivist's memories? I don't understand how any of this works.",
    "That's all of them. I'd better get these back to the Archivist.",
    "What?",
    "Pretty much.",
    "There you go. Feeling better?",
    "...",
    "...",
    "Soooo...",
    "Did you ever meet Guthix?",
    "I met Guthix.",
    "Then he died.",
    "You never seem to mention Zaros.",

    "The others all seem pretty fanatical in their faith and loyalty.",
    "Then why continue to serve Zaros now?",
    "I thought that's what you did anyway. Isn't that basically what you were doing in Falador?",
    "What about the Zamorakians, then?",
    "What can you tell me about Sliske?",
    "I didn't know him back in your time.",
    "How do you feel about that?",
    "Can we access Guthix's memories now?",
    "The elder gods. Specifically, anything concerning the elder god eggs.",

    "I need to take it to the fountain of energy outside.",
    "I've already found the engram.",
    "I should take this up to the memorial and see if the fountain can teach us anything.",
    "I've missplaced[sic] that engram. Perhaps I should search the bud in the centre for it again.",
    "Got what I came for. Don't need to disturb him further.",
    "Uh... I don't know. Nothing relevant to the eggs, at least. You?",
    "You've never been here before?",
    "It's a bit of an oversimplification, but close enough.",
    "Ga'al!",
    "I'm sorry, which Ga'al are you? You all look very similar.",

    "How are things going for TokHaar-Hok?",
    "Now I don't understand. If you're not TokHaar-Hok, who are you? You look like TokHaar-Hok.",
    "Oh.",
    "Well actually that leads me to my next question.",
    "You guys made Gielinor, right?",
    "Did you make the elder halls?",
    "That's the one.",
    "Maybe...",
    "Er... we're trying to find it, and I wondered if you could tell us where it is.",
    "That's... a no, then?",
    "You don't want to join the TokHaar?",
    "Actually I have. We're trying to find the elder halls.",
    "The elder gods. The... masters. After they created this world they laid eggs.",
    "The place where the eggs are hidden is called the elder halls. We need to find it.",
    "The TzHaar have never heard of the Elder Halls, and the TokHaar know where they are but won't tell us under any circumstances.",
    "The TokHaar are a mountain-sized, sentient, hive-minded, elder artefact filled with lava, that create and destroy massive, obsidian bodies at will.",
    "Probably best avoided. Did you find anything in the library?",
    "How much time?",
    "Maybe that could be a backup plan if nothing else pans out.",
    "Goodbye, TzHaar-Ga'al-Kot.",
    "Yes, hello. We'd like to enter the Wizards' Tower, please.",
    "This is, uh, Wizard Trindy.",
    "Of course. We're here researching the elder gods to try and save the world.",
    "Yes, I was there.",
    "Thanks!",
    "Not yet. Back in a mo.",
    "There's nothing about the elder gods here.",
    "I've already looked here.",
    "...",
    "Oh, it's about care homes in Varrock.",
    "Why do they have a whole section of old advertisements?",
    "Ooh, a first edition!",
    "...",
    "The foreword is written by the Makeover Mage?",
    "...",
    "Zaros died because he tripped and fell?",
    "He did, sixteen times!",
    "This version doesn't even mention the elder gods.",
    "It's pronounced 'Sliskay'.",
    "Actually I think you would have gotten along pretty well.",
    "Yes, but only that time I met Jas with Seren and Zaros. Nothing we don't already know.",
    "Come to think of it... who wrote this book?",
    "...'Professor Soran'?",
    "I'd better see if Trindine's had better luck.",
    "I found that someone has been documenting my recent activities, but there's nothing in that section concerning elder gods. You?",
    "I would have thought Azzanadra would come up with better leads.",
    "Have you considered not being the ancient spy of a dark lord?",
    "We still don't know where the elder eggs are.",
    "What's wrong with Ariane? And where's Sir Owen?",
    "What did you do to her?",
    "What sort of alternative?",
    "Why?",
    "Did you at least learn anything useful?",
    "All three were dead ends. Something is going on in TzHaar City but we didn't learn anything about the eggs.",
    "Are you okay?",
    "Are you okay?",
    "Oh?",
    "Please, we need to pass. We're trying to save Gielinor from the elder gods.",
    "We're working with Seren's council... sort of.",
    "I'm not sure it was a coincidence...",
    "How do we open it?",
    "I don't think there's any doubt that these are the eggs of the elder gods.",
    "We should fully investigate this egg.",
    "We've already looked at this egg, I should take a look at the others.",
    "What is?",
    "Seren told me she could sense them from afar.",
    "She said they'd become disturbed recently, as a result of Kerapac trying to poison them with his device.",
    "Quiet!",
    "Uh, I said it's quiet in here.",
    "She said another huge release of shadow anima would probably cause them to start hatching.",
    "That we know of, only Kerapac's device.",
    "Yes. Does it look like they're going to hatch naturally any time soon?",
    "So we should avoid killing any gods in this chamber?",
    "So what do we do now?",
    "We still haven't done anything to avert the threat.",
    "Yeah... I thought he'd have a plan to actually stop them from hatching.",
    "You're right. We need to check.",
    "I have a feeling that Trindine may not have been completely honest with me.",
    "I'm going to go and ask her about it.",
    "Yes, you're right. Time to go back to Kharid-et.",
    "Wow. Even from here you can feel an immense power coming from the egg.",
    "I don't have anything that can be used to charge this.",
    "There's no one here.",
    "Azzanadra did say he supercharged her after her release to make up for missing so many rituals.",
    "Maybe we can find some of her memories. I don't see any wisps around, though.",
    "Oh. How do we get there?",
    "I think I see some over there.",
    "Maybe that's enough? What does it say?",
    "She was planning to steal something?",
    "Steal what, though?",
    "When I was here earlier, was Trindine asking about anything other than the eggs of the masters?",
    "Questions about what?",
    "Was there anything in particular she wanted to know?",
    "What's the Locator?",
    "Thanks Ga'al.",
    "Yes?",
    "Wait, what? Where is what?",
    "Hold on, slow down. What book?",
    "Trindine stole a book?",
    "I'm sorry. I think she may have been deceiving me. What was the book about?",
    "So you're saying that if Saradomin is separated from his crown, he loses his power?",
    "Interesting.",
    "I will try to return the book if I can. Right now I have the feeling something terrible is going to happen.",
    "What?",
    "Which memory? Which user?",
    "What was in that memory?",
    "Thank you, Archivist.",
    "What do we do now?",
    "Let's talk to Ariane. Maybe she can help figure out exactly what Trindine is planning.",
    "That's fascinating, but I think we may have a problem. Trindine was researching Saradomin's crown.",
    "I don't know why, but at all the locations we visited together, while I was researching the eggs, she was researching the crown.",
    "I think they might be trying to steal it.",
    "I know. So what's going on? If it was something helpful, why wouldn't they just tell us?",
    "Why?",
    "No, I don't think I do.",
    "Oh, yeah, of course. What about this? I absorbed some of her shed anima in Kharid-et.",
    "Whatever they're planning, it can't be good.",
    "I'm not sure who I trust less.",
    "Wait!",
    "Zarosians are here, they're planning something during the ceremony!",
    "Sir Vey Lance is secretly a demon! He's going to turn the Temple Knights against you!",
    "Let things play out for now.",
    "Err, who, me?",
    "I, uh, I think it's safe to say I couldn't have stopped Zaros if I tried.",

    "I see the whole gang is here.",
    "Wait, what?",
    "What about Sir Owen?",
    "You didn't go with them?",

    "I think... I think I might have seen them.",
    "The visions I mentioned. I saw the adults... I think. Perhaps the young? It's unclear.",
    "They shared a form. A sinuous body, endless in length, bursting into a flower at the head.",
    "Oh yes, I heard about that. Is it possible you only saw Jas's head?",
    "It's still hot. It is magical, I suppose.",

    "I don't know what Mah could be. Shadow, perhaps? But shadow isn't a rune either.",
    "We'd better hope otherwise if we're going to save Gielinor.",

    "Sensing the impending birth of their young, the adults pressed in close.",
    "With a touch they imparted their identities and their memories.",

    "Their mere presence drained all life from the cavern around them.",
    "Within moments every other living thing nearby was dead, drained of all life.",
    "Nothing could stop them. The world was doomed.",
    "Further and further their reach expanded, blanketing everything.",
    "Minutes later, Freneskae was a desolate husk.",
    "The sated hatchlings travelled out into the universe to remake it.",
    "In time they grew old and hid eggs of their own beneath the surface of Gielinor.",
    "When they hatch, our world will suffer the same fate as Freneskae.",
    "We must stop them... somehow.",

    "We need to stop the same thing happening to Gielinor.",

    "What should we do? I've never been a Saradominist, but can we really let the Zarosians finish whatever they're planning?",

    "So get them better equipment?",

    "They're White Knights for Saradomin's sake. They'll find themselves facing black knights, demons and worse before too long.",
    "It's not like there isn't enough money here, or ore. The church of Saradomin is the largest religion, we have connections with every major human kingdom.",
    "There's plenty of resources to make sure these knights are ready for battle. This shouldn't be so difficult.",
    "Exactly! Can you imagine this lot trying to deal with Mother Mallum and her slugs?",

    "Okay, I'll admit it, that's worse. At least I could get olives delivered.",
    "Er, about those orders though. Do you have anything for me?",
    "Yes, Sir Sonde? What is it?",
    "Well, it's the power behind the throne, isn't it?",
    "You know that feeling you've always had.",
    "That feeling that things aren't what they seem. The feeling that someone else is in control. The feeling that someone is pulling the strings behind the scenes.",
    "Er, well, that was me. Bit of a wheeze, eh?",
    "Alright, alright, I can see you're finding this challenging. Let's see if I can explain it in simpler terms.",
    "Let's cast our minds back to about five thousand years in the past. One happens to find oneself in command of the Order of the Temple of Zaros, but things aren't going so well for our chaps.",
    "The Empty Lord is long gone. The Pontifex Maximus is missing in action. The Praetorian Prefect has buggered off to Lord-knows-where. Even your friend here never returned from Kharid-et.",
    "We've lost control of Senntisten to Zamorak. Bleeding savages are running rampant all over the empire. The whole place is in an absolute bloody shambles.",
    "So grand old Duke Sucellus, who's running the whole show now there's no one else left, comes up with a plan, mm, and quite the plan it was.",
    "Saradomin is doing about the best and old Sucellus reckons it's on account of his crown.",
    "So he comes to me and he tells me to take the entire order of knights on a deep cover operation. Reckons if we can pinch the crown that'll put the Zarosians back on top again.",
    "I mean it seems like a rather large demand to me, but never let it be said that I'm not one to rise to the challenge.",
    "So our part of the plan, of course, goes off without a hitch. Absolutely smashing job.",
    "Obviously Saradomin is suspicious at first, but Zarosians are converting all over the empire and after we take out the Angel of Death our loyalty and usefulness are beyond question.",
    "Only problem is, Sucellus gets nobbled long before he has a chance to actually pull off the heist. Now here I am, stuck with my pseudopodia swinging in the wind with no orders and no direction.",
    "Saradomin doesn't take long conquering the whole continent, and my last orders were to help where I can, so that's what I do. Got to get orders from somewhere, what?",
    "Had a few close calls here and there. A few chaps needed to be put out of the picture, and the less said about King Vallance the better.",
    "Anyway long story short, I'm still here and hoping my orders have finally arrived.",
    "Sometimes I think I'd have been better off in the abyss with the others than stuck here this whole time.",
    "Speaking purely for myself, I don't put much stock in faith. I'm more of an orders sort of chap. Just wind me up and point me in the right direction, that's good enough for me.",
    "You strike me as more of a man of principle.",
    "You already pledged your allegiance to the Temple Knights, dear boy. This is just the next logical extension of that.",
    "Sometimes doing what's right isn't the same thing as doing what Saradomin commands you to do. Isn't that the very reason you joined in the first place?",
    "He doesn't answer to the likes of us, Sir Sonde. If we needed to know, I'm sure he'd tell us.",
    "Oh dear. I'm sorry to hear that.",
    "I rather think you won't.",
    "Is he dead?",
    "Are you going soft, Praetor?",
    "I suppose not. So, orders?",
    "Oh, you want to actually finish the original plan?",
    "Well, the Temple Knights are good and ready. Most of them, anyway.",
    "Chaps who've completed their final initiation already know that we serve another, and they're good and ready for the true master to be revealed.",
    "Owen here never made it that far, of course, and I have my doubts about Sir Tiffy, but the rest should be in smashing shape.",
    "What we really need though is a sniff of the old loyalty aura to reassure them. I assume we can't expect a visit from the top?",
    "As expected, that is rather his MO. Well, I do have a backup plan.",
    "The easiest way I can see is to recover an artefact known as the Frostenhorn, which-",
    "Ah, absolutely splendid! I must say it's nice to be working with professionals again.",
    "When the moment comes, I'll give a peep on the old horn, broadcast the after effects on me, then zing-zang-zoop and Bob's your uncle.",
    "As for stealing the crown, the plan is a little out of date but as luck would have it recent events could be to our advantage.",
    "You see Saradomin is feeling somewhat guilty about abandoning his followers here on Gielinor so soon after returning.",
    "I happen to have dug up a ceremony of sorts which should fit the bill nicely, while giving us the opening we need."
