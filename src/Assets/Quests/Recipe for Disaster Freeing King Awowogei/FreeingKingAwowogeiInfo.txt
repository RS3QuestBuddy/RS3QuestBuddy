Talk to the three wise monkeys two more times (first discussing the banana and then the same for the monkey nuts).`
Note: Each of the three following can be done in any order. The wise monkeys will eat any red bananas or tchiki nuts you have if you return to them and you may burn the dish or accidentally eat it while handling it. Therefore, it is a good idea to collect more than one of each.`
