    "Ah, good. I had hoped to see you, Player. I need your help.",
    "I understand. When you have the time, please come speak to me. We are all in danger.",
    "Wonderful. Let me tell you the situation.",
    "I am soon to be crowned. It is a burden that I do not take lightly.",
    "As Basilissa, it is my duty to see that the kingdoms are protected.",
    "Right now, there is one looming threat that haunts me; that threatens us all.",
    "The Civil War is over. Bilrach won.",
    "The demons, defeated, fell in line and joined the ranks of his army.",
    "Bilrach is in a position to launch a full-scale invasion.",
    "But it is not enough.\u00a0The\u00a0powerful always crave more power.",
    "He greedily seeks more ways to expand his influence and cement his dominance.",
    "Even now, he gathers his forces and spreads out across the world in search of something.",
    "Lost magic? An artefact?",
    "Whatever he is trying to do, it represents a terrible threat to the rest of the world.",
    "We must stop him. We must put an end to his reign, before it begins.",
    "As you can see, while the threat of the Civil War is over, we are still not safe. Bilrach is planning something and I believe we're all in danger.",
    "Our spies have kept tabs on his forces, trying to get a glimpse of his plans. But we've learned nothing.",
    "At least, until recently.",
    "We've tracked down a contingent of Bilrach's forces sneaking into the prisons of Senntisten. We don't know what they were after, but it can't be good.",
    "Soon I will be coronated. I shall be named Basilissa.",
    "I have a duty to safeguard my people. To protect them.",
    "I do not accept this role lightly. But once I am crowned, I will not be able to face these threats directly. As a ruler I must rely on others to risk themselves on my orders.",
    "So, now, I would like to join you. This is my last chance to get my hands dirty and to stand directly before the threat.",
    "I'm no fighter, but I want to help.",
    "Are you ready to go?",
    "Great. It will feel good to get out of here for a bit. Let's go to Senntisten.",
    "The entrance to Senntisten is east of Varrock, between the lumber yard and dig site.",
    "I accept my duty and will rule with everything I have. But I'm not sure 'looking forward' to it is the right term.",
    "I've spent my entire life in education - studying Saradominist doctrine and law, the art of statecraft... everything I could possibly need to succeed my father.",
    "I am what my father made me, and I was made to rule. But I've never known anything but study, and the great, wide world has never seemed...well, greater. Or wider.",
    "I won't deny that I've wondered what possibilities lie beyond my world of scrolls and tomes. But honestly, I've lived a privileged, comfortable life with opportunities most can only dream of.",
    "Plus, I REALLY like books.",
    "Do not think unkindly of my father. He only wants what is best for me, and he believes I am best for this world.",
    "I am honoured by his trust, and grateful for all he has taught me. I shall do everything in my power to prove him right.",
    "But as my coronation looms, I feel the weight of an invisible crown. Sometimes it feels too much to bear.",
    "Sorry, I'm sure you don't want to deal with my worries. There are more pressing matters afoot.",
    "To rule as justly and as fairly as I can.",
    "Not exciting, I know, but it's the honest truth.",
    "There is much work to do here. Old grudges to patch up, ancient wounds to heal.",
    "And new threats to thwart, of course. I'm not sure I have time for long-term plans at the moment.",
    "Not until we fix a few things.",
    "He is the leader of the Zamorakian forces. A religious order bent on pure chaos. That can't be good for the world.",
    "Now that he stands unopposed by the demon army, he will turn his attention to the rest of the world.",
    "He's planning something big. All our intelligence suggests he's gathering a larger force in preparation for something terrible.",
    "Bilrach cannot be allowed to harm the innocent people of Gielinor.",
    "Okay, let me know when you are ready.",
    "Alright, we'll talk later.",
    "Here we are. Isn't Senntisten a marvel?",
    "Here we are. Isn't Senntisten a marvel? So much history. So much knowledge just buried beneath the surface.",
    "I would give anything to grab a mattock and sift through the memories of this place.",
    "But there's no time for that. Right now we need to find out what Bilrach's forces were up to here.",
    "We need to discover what Bilrach's forces were up to here.",
    "Look at it! The design is so elegant. The techniques these ancient architects used were astounding.",
    "But there's something else...Look, do you see it?",
    "Shadow magic. Expertly - and recently - wrought.",
    "I'm normally of the opinion that magic is neither good nor evil, only a tool to be used. But I can think of very few positive uses of shadow magic here.",
    "Look at their wounds! The damage is brutal.",
    "Well, someone larger than a human was here. I'd wager a good eight feet tall or so.",
    "They took something large and heavy out of here. Some ancient device perhaps? A buried object of power?",
    "Those scratch marks are deep.",
    "Okay, I can see how all of this fits together. From what I can tell, I think it went down like this...",
    "I may have indulged in a teeny bit of artistic license. But you get the idea.",
    "Alright, you got me. General Khazard isn't a murderous, cackling overlord whose hobbies include pushing puzzle blocks with his mind. But go with it.",
    "Look - when you've been buried under legislative documents for the last week, you find your own fun.",
    "Come on - that's definitely what he's saying! He's...",
    "Oh, fine.",
    "A new ritual marker? One that Zaros had been experimenting with? But why?",
    "Mahjarrat no longer need to sustain their lives with rituals. So what's it for?",
    "You're right. There's more to this puzzle. Thinking about it, what we've learned lines up with some other intelligence we've received.",
    "There were reports of strange figures seen in the Menaphos library. I'd put it aside as the data was unclear, but I think we need to investigate this now.",
    "Our next lead is to investigate the Grand Library in the Imperial District of Menaphos.",
    "We need to head to the library. Access is through that little door on the side of the pyramid, if you get lost.",
    "I love this library smell.",
    "Books!",
    "I love them so much.",
    "My most loyal and trusted friends.",
    "My paperback buddies.",
    "I've spent all day reading.",
    "It was bound to happen.",
    "I have no shelf control.",
    "I'm blinded by library science.",
    "I couldn't reach some of these books...",
    "...I had to use a shelfie stick.",
    "I wanted to visit the world's biggest library...",
    "...but it was overbooked.",
    "Libraries make shhh happen.",
    "What's the tallest building in Menaphos?",
    "The library, because it has the most stories.",
    "Bibliotherapy is a novel prescription.",
    "Sorry for all of the library jokes...",
    "I'll put them on hold.",
    "Look at this place! Isn't it neat? Wouldn't you think all these books are so... Wait, where was I?",
    "There's so much knowledge here. Walls of stories, aeons of history all pressed tightly together. I could stay here for weeks.",
    "But right now we have bigger issues to deal with. Our intelligence suggests that Zamorakian forces were sighted in this city.",
    "There are three places of interest that we should investigate. The Magister's chamber, the Soul Altar and - of course - here, in the Grand Library.",
    "My reports say Enakhra was here.",
    "Yes... The Mahjarrat do have a way of crawling out of the woodwork, don't they? The question is why? What was she looking for?",
    "According to her dossier, she's not a subtle creature - even for a Zamorakian.",
    "Apparently she holds scholars in particular contempt, and has been known to wilfully damage books.",
    "Reprehensible. But perhaps we can look for any damaged books as clues.",
    "Hopefully the librarians can repair any damage she caused.",
    "Our intelligence agents reported seeing someone scouting the area. What they were looking for we don't know.",
    "The Magister's chamber is a place in the dungeon of Sophanem. It's where a powerful necromancer can be found.",
    "Perhaps they were looking to recruit him? Seems unlikely, but we should investigate anyway.",
    "I'm not keen on anyone dealing with something like that. I know soul runes aren't actually stolen human souls, but still, unpleasant.",
    "But the Zamorakians messing around with it can't be good. Our intelligence suggests some sort of monster was seen breaking in there.",
    "Exaggeration most likely, but we should take a look around just in case.",
    "Enakhra isn't subtle. She apparently just waltzed in here and began looking through books.",
    "It should be easy enough to find what she was looking at and what books she might have taken.",
    "My reports say the Zamorakian Mahjarrat Enakhra was here, and thanks to your clues, I think I know what she was looking for.",
    "Hopefully the librarians can repair the books she damaged.",
    "They're investigating the Teragardian Magister? Why?",
    "They were my father's people. Long before he became a god. He rarely spoke of them, though.",
    "We don't know a great deal about them, but we do know that they had great insight into the manipulation of mortal souls.",
    "Quite.",
    "Hmm. Why are they interested in Amascut and her corruption?",
    "May I see?",
    "Huh. Verbose, but well argued.",
    "It's a theory about what happens when souls are 'devoured', as common parlance would have it. Crucially, the various ways they might empower the devourer...",
    "Necromancy. It's a staple of the Zamorakian forces, so why do they need to read up on it here?",
    "No, I don't think so. This is more of a discourse on what it means to be undead, what happens to trapped souls... Terrible, really.",
    "Indeed. And I don't like it.",
    "I think I'm starting to see a pattern. We should investigate somewhere else.",
    "Well, it doesn't look destroyed, which is good, and they haven't taken the soul obelisk.",
    "Still, let's look around and see what we can find.",
    "I think we've found everything out of place here. Let's look for more clues elsewhere.",
    "Look at these. You don't often see bones that are so strongly imbued with magic.",
    "Necromancy.",
    "They broke a bit off the soul obelisk? But why? Surely they'd want the whole thing?",
    "Both of those ideas are plausible. And terrifying.",
    "Hmm, this seems to be the lingering residue of some powerful magic. Not normal rune magic either.",
    "Yes. Let's be careful.",
    "I think that's probably everything we're going to find here. We should look somewhere else.",
    "Well this place is disturbing. I'm not sure what I expected, really.",
    "I don't see any obvious damage or Zamorkian interference. Let's look around.",
    "I think we've found everything of note at the Soul Altar. Let's move on.",
    "Look at these. There was some sort of struggle here. Look at the depth of the groove. Someone powerful did this.",
    "Wait, this damage looks recent. It looks deliberate. Are those claw marks?",
    "Were they taking a piece of the Soul Altar? But why?",
    "Hmm, I'm beginning to get a better sense of what went on here. I think we've got enough from here. We should investigate elsewhere.",
    "Okay, I've been thinking through everything we've found.",
    "I'm going to need your help to re-enact what happened. So you have freedom of movement, I'll happily get an aide to run everything you're wearing and carrying to your bank.",
    "Lovely. This is what I've got so far...",
    "I don't like this, Player. From what we've found, it seems that the Zamorakians are researching soul magic and necromancy.",
    "That sort of power is invariably misused. But when you add in the ritual marker they stole from Senntisten... the big picture starts to get even scarier.",
    "Come on. Let's return to Falador and see if we can plot our next move.",
    "We should head back to the throne room in Falador.",
    "Meet my intelligence agent.",
    "No, Trindine. You will not insult us here, in my throne room. Unless you want to see the sunrise tomorrow through a barred window.",
    "Why are you here, Trindine?",
    "Well, we can't smuggle any Daemonheim armour out from the dungeons. So we need to think of a new way to get a disguise.",
    "Perfect. Player, let's see if we can find that ore and get ourselves a disguise.",
    "For both of us, we're looking at 28 argonite ore to smith what we need.",
    "Of course I am. I can't very well let Player have to deal with everything on their own.",
    "I think we should go before Trindine somehow makes this more awkward.",
    "Are you ready to go?",
    "Okay, let's go!",
    "We need to find the argonite ore that's emerged from the surface near Daemonheim. According to the directions Trindine gave me, we're about [number] paces away.",
    "Somewhere in the south-east Wilderness near the Daemonheim peninsula, I would expect.",
    "We need [number] more ore.",
    "Okay, let me know when you are ready.",
    "There's no reason for me to go back up there.",
    "That looks somewhat like argonite ore to me. Let's get to work. I'll keep hold of the ore for you just in case anything happens in the Wilderness.",
    "We need [number] more ore.",
    "That...looks like hard work.",
    "I've not seen that metal before.",
    "You know, for science.",
    "Could you save me a bit",
    "Let's hurry. Don't want to be noticed.",
    "Nearly there.",
    "Good yield from these rocks.",
    "Good work - keep going!",
    "That looks like enough ore to me. There's a furnace to smelt this ore in the gargoyle-infested ruins between the Wilderness Crater and Daemonheim.",
    "I have no idea what you could do with that.",
    "You'll need to smith all the ore into bars, so we can make the outfit. I'll keep hold of any bars you make to keep them safe.",
    "This metal has some fascinating properties.",
    "Melting point around 1032...give or take.",
    "Mind you don't burn yourself.",
    "Could you save me a bit",
    "Let's hurry. Don't want to be noticed.",
    "Nearly there.",
    "Good yield from these rocks.",
    "Good work - keep going!",
    "It... It's almost relaxing to watch.",
    "Should make for some sturdy armor",
    "We should keep a low profile and smith our outfits near where recruitment is taking place. I think there's an anvil near the Mage Arena. We should use that.",
    "Wilderness monsters get nastier the further north we go. A safer route to the deepest wilderness is to pull a lever south of Edgeville, near the Slayer master.",
    "If the rumours I've heard are true, that lever should teleport us to a deserted keep, east of the Mage Arena. The anvil should be north then west of there.",
    "Now we need to smith the bars into disguises for the two of us.",
    "We'll each need a full set of armour. You should smith a platebody, helm, gauntlets, boots and platelegs for yourself.",
    "I'd like a helm, a chainbody, a plateskirt, gauntlets and boots, please.",
    "Ooh, throwing knives. Make me throwing knives.",
    "Not even a little bit.",
    "Sounds like a plan.",
    "If you lose anything you've made, come chat to me. I'll keep an eye out for...things.",
    "This is a pickaxe?",
    "Ah well, it's mostly for show anyway. I'm not really much of a fighter. I'll be relying on your skills there.",
    "Well, regardless, thank you. I'm going to head to the Mage Arena now and try out this disguise. I'll meet you there.",
    "I wish there was something I could do to help. But I'm no fighter.",
    "Bilrach didn't think to inspect the marker before his ritual, and it cost him dearly.",
    "He sought the power he felt was owed to him.",
    "He dreamed of draining souls from across the world, becoming unrivalled in his power.",
    "In a world without gods, he would rule without opposition.",
    "Unrivalled. Untouchable. But it was not to be.",
    "Your sabotage turned the power Bilrach summoned into the marker against itself.",
    "Magic surged until the structure could contain it no longer.",
    "In a great thunderclap, the marker exploded, shattering across the Wilderness like a bad dream.",
    "The power contained returned to the dirt and the soil. The shards of soul it harnessed returned to the underworld to await their afterlife.",
    "Bilrach had failed. His plan ruined. His dreams of glory shattered like the marker.",
    "In one act of sabotage, the world was safe once more. None even knew they'd been at risk.",
    "Bilrach's army remained. It was still a threat. Still a terrible danger.",
    "But the infallibility of his leadership was gone; his authority lost, like his dreams of dominion.",
    "We did it! We stopped his evil scheme. I never doubted you, though I wasn't sure I would be any help. But we did it.",
    "Oh I don't know; we saved the souls of half the human kingdoms. I think it's a good adventure to end on.",
    "Oh. I thought we worked well together.",
    "Regardless, this is the last time I can really be out in the field like that.",
    "Soon I will be crowned as Basilissa and will have no more time for such adventures.",
    "I shall enable others to become heroes. I shall use my power to lift them up and let them save the world.",
    "A far better use of my time.",
    "Though we have to actually have the coronation first. I never knew how much organisation goes into one of these.",
    "We have guests coming, dignitaries from all the human kingdoms. Each of them needs to have a seat at the table and each one of them thinks they're as important as the last.",
    "I have to try and place them all on the head table, for the banquet, but it's much more of a headache than I expected.",
    "I'd really appreciate it, but are you sure? It's not exactly saving the world.",
    "As always, your help is welcome. Though I apologise if you start to look back fondly on the world-ending threats after talking to these dignitaries for a few minutes.",
    "There are times during diplomatic meetings I have longed for an apocalypse.",
    "There are four dignitaries and only four seats at the table. The table is long and sits at the top of the room, with all guests on it facing the same direction, out to the crowd.",
    "As Basilissa I am seated in the middle and the other guests are seated around me.",
    "Sounds simple right? People can just sit either side of me?",
    "Wrong! If we sit people in the wrong place, it might offend them, or they might conflict with their neighbour.",
    "The slightest mistake and we could turn dinner into a diplomatic disaster!",
    "So no pressure or anything.",
    "Have a chat with each of the guests and see if you can work out where they should be seated.",
    "When you're happy with your decision, come and speak to me.",
    "How is it going?",
    "We need to work out the seating plan for the ambassadors. It might sound silly, but the wrong person in the wrong place could spark a diplomatic incident.",
    "Wars have been started over the wrong person saying the wrong thing in the wrong ear. So we need to be careful.",
    "Everyone will be seated on a single table facing out in the same direction. There will be two places to my left and two places to my right.",
    "All you need to do is talk to the ambassadors and work out which are the right places to put each of them in.",
    "When you've decided on your order, come back and talk to me.",
    "Excellent, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Let's start with who will sit furthest away from me on my left.",
    "I understand, it's a difficult decision to make. Why not go and talk to them again to see if you can work out the best way to seat them?",
    "Great, what about the person nearest me on my left?",
    "I think you confused yourself. That's the same person in two seats. Maybe take a minute and come back to this with a clear head. I know it's a headache, believe me I know.",
    "I think you confused yourself. That's the same person in two seats. Maybe take a minute and come back to this with a clear head. I know it's a headache, believe me I know.",
    "I think you confused yourself. That's the same person in two seats. Maybe take a minute and come back to this with a clear head. I know it's a headache, believe me I know.",
    "I think you confused yourself. That's the same person in two seats. Maybe take a minute and come back to this with a clear head. I know it's a headache, believe me I know.",
    "I understand, it's a difficult decision to make. Why not go and talk to them again to see if you can work out the best way to seat them?",
    "Now, what about the person furthest from me on my right?",
    "I think you confused yourself. That's the same person in two seats. Maybe take a minute and come back to this with a clear head. I know it's a headache, believe me I know.",
    "I think you confused yourself. That's the same person in two seats. Maybe take a minute and come back to this with a clear head. I know it's a headache, believe me I know.",
    "I think you confused yourself. That's the same person in two seats. Maybe take a minute and come back to this with a clear head. I know it's a headache, believe me I know.",
    "I think you confused yourself. That's the same person in two seats. Maybe take a minute and come back to this with a clear head. I know it's a headache, believe me I know.",
    "I understand, it's a difficult decision to make. Why not go and talk to them again to see if you can work out the best way to seat them?",
    "And the last seat?",
    "I think you confused yourself. That's the same person in two seats. Maybe take a minute and come back to this with a clear head. I know it's a headache, believe me I know.",
    "I think you confused yourself. That's the same person in two seats. Maybe take a minute and come back to this with a clear head. I know it's a headache, believe me I know.",
    "I think you confused yourself. That's the same person in two seats. Maybe take a minute and come back to this with a clear head. I know it's a headache, believe me I know.",
    "I think you confused yourself. That's the same person in two seats. Maybe take a minute and come back to this with a clear head. I know it's a headache, believe me I know.",
    "I understand, it's a difficult decision to make. Why not go and talk to them again to see if you can work out the best way to seat them?",
    "Hmm, no, that seems wrong somehow. Maybe chat with them again and see if you can find the best positions for everyone.",
    "Oh yes, that sounds perfect! Are you sure you want to be an adventurer, Player? You'd be great as a diplomat.",
    "Well, adventuring suits you. Right, it's time. I'm ready. Are you ready? Maybe I'm not ready?",
    "Saradomin's light, it's really going to happen, isn't it? I'm going to become Basilissa.",
    "I was, I AM, it's just... well, it's real now, isn't it? Not just a phrase, not just a future thing. It's here. It's now.",
    "No, I'll be fine. It's probably good that I'm nervous. As I think anyone stepping into a position such as this should be.",
    "I have the weight of so many lives in my hands now. I need to make sure I treat the role with the gravity it deserves.",
    "Just, promise me one little thing, okay? When I'm this big, powerful, empress. Come say hello from time to time?",
    "Thank you. I know it sounds silly, but that means a lot. It's going to be difficult to find real friends when I'm wearing that crown.",
    "Oh, yes, I suppose you're right. Keep the heroes away from the political, that makes sense. Still, I will miss having you around my friend.",
    "Right. There's no point putting this off any longer. It's time to face destiny.",
    "My people, it is a heavy responsibility to wear this crown. To bear the burdens of serving you. But I do so not with fear, not with glee, but with tremendous love for you all.",
    "As I have walked the cities, I have seen compassion, joy and kindness at every corner. I have seen the bravery of everyone from the armoured knight to the tireless shopkeeper.",
    "I have visited worlds made of crystal and and seen stars made of music, but in all my travels I have never seen anything as wonderous as all of you.",
    "I promise that I shall do everything in my power to keep you safe. Everything I can, to make your lives just a little bit better each and every day.",
    "I cannot do this alone, but I know that I am not. For just as I stand with each of you, so do I know, in my heart, that you all stand with me.",
    "Thank you. Thank you for letting me bear the burden of this crown. I will try my best to live up to it.",
    "Thank you, thank you all. I have no words for a speech. What words could possibly convey the gratitude I feel right now? For your respect and your love?",
    "There is a song that is sung on Hallow. It is memorised and passed on from parent to child. Each time we add our own voice to it, to change it and make it part of a living story.",
    "I would like to share mine with you all. As the story now grows with you.",
    "Almighty Saradomin",
    "Welcome a new dawn on this horizon",
    "Almighty Saradomin!",
    "Come my divine spirits to glory",
    "Goodbye.",
    "We are the holy light Strength of a burning sun Heroes of Gielinor",
    "Look to the sky Hope never dies",
    "Come, do not be afraid The light shall be your guide The sun shall conquer all",
    "Look to a star Call it a name",
    "Gaze to the light Defeat the night Beacons of hope and fire",
    "Strike down the dark Come make your mark Be the righteous and the hope",
    "Open your power from within",
    "This is our song of hope and dreams",
    "My spirits of this land",
    "This sunset will open a new age",
    "Almighty Saradomin",
    "Welcome a new dawn on this horizon",
    "Almighty Saradomin!",
    "Come my divine spirits to glory",
    "Something worrying. I'll have our...my spies investigate. Perhaps it was nothing, just a random convergence of magical energies. But I suspect not.",
    "Not a terribly auspicious start to my rule.",
    "But it's done. I am Basilissa now and all that comes with that. You would not believe the paperwork I have to complete.",
    "It was wonderful, being on this last adventure with you. We will work together again - often, I hope - but perhaps not in quite the same way again.",
    "It was an honour to stand beside you. To fight beside you. Even if I did only have a pickaxe.",
    "Thank you, Player. The world doesn't tell you that enough, so let me tell you again. Honestly, and with everything I have, thank you.",
    "I appreciate your support in these challenging times, Player."

  "Player": [
    "Haven't you ever wanted to follow your own path?",
    "The light...it's refracting...almost as if it were shying away.",
    "The question is...what was it used for?",
    "Whoever did this was large and dangerous. We should be careful.",
    "Probably in heavy armour, too, given the depth of the print.",
    "Looks like it took a huge effort. Whatever it was, it must've been worth a great deal to them.",
    "They must've dragged something huge out of here.",
    "Hang on. Adrasteia, are you sure this is what happened?",

    "As you stand there, you spot an enemy scout limping away from you, a missive in her hand.",
    "Good. The location lacks strategic value. That missive could alter the war.",

    "But now we would be down a soldier and I would know that you have no loyalty. Wars are won by the bonds we have with one another. Loyalty is stronger than any steel.",
    "You would betray a friend on the random whim of a stranger. I have no use for traitors. Go.",
    "Good. I gave you no reason to kill her, except my whim. It is right to refuse until I give you a real reason.",
    "As soldiers, we are bound together by our loyalty. A shared vision and the absolute knowledge that we are there for one another.",
    "By refusing to kill her without reason, you prove you're willing to stand up for your fellows. I can use this.",

    "There is no shame in being prepared. Return to me when you are ready.",

    "I may not have been conscripted, but I can fight.",

    "Bilrach was here and he wanted something from the most powerful mage present, Kolodion.",

    "Oh no!",

    "Sometimes, a container is just as useful as what it once contained.",
    "Is there a way to break that rune down a bit? Make it into smaller pieces? I can imbue them with magic to make them more volatile, but they'd need to be smaller if we're going to hide them.",
    "I'd use my pickaxe but, well, I have no experience in mining. I'd rather not injure us both. Maybe there's something else sharp in this cave you could use?",
    "I don't think it's useful like that. Maybe you can do something to it?",
    "That reminds of a fairy tale my father used to read to me.",
    "Something about painting roses a different colour, so a nasty queen wouldn't explode with rage.",
    "Okay, give me a moment.",

    "Bring the pieces to me. I can imbue them with some volatile magic to make them a little more dangerous.",
    "Not remotely!",
