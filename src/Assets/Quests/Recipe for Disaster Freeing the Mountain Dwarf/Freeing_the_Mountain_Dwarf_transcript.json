    "I'm sure another pint will go down nicely.",
    "You're a good friend Rohak, do you think you could do me a favour?",
    "I don't need you to do that ... friend. Just something as simple as baking me some of your wonderful rock cakes. Hmm? For your good friend?",
    "Good. I'm sure I have some gold somewhere!",
    "How much gold do you want to make the cake?",
    "No, not a dream, you agreed to make me your special rock cake, for a fee.",

    "Well... here's the ingredients anyway.",
    "Not yet but I will. I'm going to save your son.",
    "I appear to have lost it somewhere, can you make me another?",

  "Fortuneteller": [
    "To protect our short angry friend from the culinaromancer's magics, I suggest that you seek out his father within the mountain tunnel that he guards. His fondness for rock cakes could prove key in freeing him.",
    "STOP! What do you think you're doing!",
    "You can't feed him red hot rock cakes! You'll kill him! Find a way to cool them down.",
    "I hear there's a rather chilly reception on top of a rather icey mountain.",

    "I would never give away me special rock cake recipe, not for all the golden nectar from the Rising Sun!",
    "Is that what I think it is?",
    "That's from the Rising Sun, the barmaid there will never tell me the recipe she uses. It's divine!",
    "No! I shwears I'll never tell...",
    "Don't mind if I do!",
    "Don't mind if I do!",

    "Have you forgotten the ingredients list? I'll need an egg, a pot of flour, a bucket of milk and a bowl of water to make these cakes for you.",
    "That's all well and good...but come back when you have all the ingredients. You're lucky Dwarves stick to their word else I might not make these cakes for you.",
    "What did you say?",
    "No you couldn't, there's a special ingredient, but I'm not going to tell you what it is!",
    "There, as good as my word. Hot rock cakes to my special recipe.",
