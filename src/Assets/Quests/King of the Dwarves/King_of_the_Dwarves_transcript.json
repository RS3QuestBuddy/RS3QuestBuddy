  "Lava-flow miner Sven": [
    "Are you interested in dwarven mining? If you're an experienced miner, you might appreciate a tour of the Lava Flow Mine.",
    "Alright, are you ready now?",
    "It's where the city gets most of its power. We've tapped into a magma vent, and we use its heat to power the steam machinery that runs the mine carts.",
    "Player, welcome back!",
    "Everyone, this is Player! [He/She] helped out during the chaos dwarf attack! [He's/She's] a hero! Just...  a hero!",
    "Player, feel free to work the Lava Flow Mine - it's a great source of Mining experience. I'm right here if you have any questions.",
    "You can go into the Lava Flow Mine if you want now, human.",
    "Three of them recovered. I'm afraid one was too badly wounded. If it wasn't for you, though, they'd all be dead.",
    "If it wasn't, we wouldn't be standing here. Everything in the city relies on it - heat, water circulation, even clean air. The central boilers have been breaking more often since the incident, but we've been keeping on top of the repairs."
  ],
  "Player": [
    "I'd like the tour.",
    "What's the Lava Flow Mine?",
    "I tried to save the miners, but I wasn't fast enough.",
    "The Black Guard left the miners to die!",
    "The guards said their orders were to fix the machinery.",
    "They walked right past the dying miners!",
    "What makes you think Veldaban was involved?",
    "It was a chaos dwarf!",
    "You'll take Veldaban over my dead body!",
    "What do I need to do?",
    "Why did they arrest you?",
    "Why are you so angry?",
    "It's more complicated than that.",
    "You should try to calm down.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "Why did you arrest Veldaban?",
    "Veldaban's popular. Arresting him makes you look worse.",
    "You mean you don't think Veldaban was involved?",
    "Is it even legal for you to hold Veldaban?",
    "Tell me about the Lava Flow Mine.",
    "What did you want to do about the miners?",
    "I was there when the explosion happened.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "Why did you arrest Veldaban?",
    "Tell me about the Lava Flow Mine.",
    "What did you want to do about the miners?",
    "You made the right choice.",
    "It was a difficult decision. I understand.",
    "You killed those miners. You're a monster.",
    "I was there when the explosion happened.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "Why did you arrest Veldaban?",
    "Tell me about the Lava Flow Mine.",
    "So the chaos dwarf blew up the primary boilers?",
    "So the chaos dwarf blew up the secondary boilers?",
    "So the chaos dwarf blew up the distribution vents?",
    "What did you want to do about the miners?",
    "I was there when the explosion happened.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "Why did you arrest Veldaban?",
    "Tell me about the Lava Flow Mine.",
    "What did you want to do about the miners?",
    "I was there when the explosion happened.",
    "It was a chaos dwarf.",
    "I saw the Black Guards abandon the miners.",
    "I rescued some of the miners.",
    "Goodbye.",
    "I've talked to everyone I need to.",
    "Why are only four directors here?",
    "Who are you, anyway?",
    "I'll go and talk to them.",
    "Does anyone know where Meike is?",
    "Don't listen to Hreidmar!",
    "He's abducting people and turning them into chaos dwarves!",
    "He took his company out of the city.",
    "He bribed the boatman to destroy the statue.",
    "He's got a twirly moustache! He's clearly a villain!",
    "I should go.",
    "I should go.",
    "We're looking for Meike.",
    "We really need to find Meike.",
    "Are you alright?",
    "You're not joining the protests?",
    "Goodbye.",
    "We're looking for Meike.",
    "We should just kill him.",
    "We should discredit him.",
    "We could get into the records chamber first.",
    "I'll meet you both at the library.",
    "Could you open the display case, please?",
    "Here, take this soft clay.",
    "Can you tell me more about the library?",
    "How do these eras correspond with the Ages of the world?",
    "Thanks for the information!",
    "What do you know about impenetrable rocks?",
    "The big one in the mines south of the city. Dondakan's big rock.",
    "Yes, what exactly does that mean anyway?",
    "Does that mean I will have to deal with this demon again some time?",
    "Can you tell me more about the keys?",
    "Can you show me the way to the Barendir caverns?",
    "What did Meike mean, you don't want to face it?",
    "Have you really been agitating against the Consortium?",
    "I have to do something else.",
    "Never mind.",
    "What's that way?",
    "Pretty Flower?",
    "Oh, okay.",
    "Oh, okay.",
    "We should go after him.",
    "Let him go. He's not a threat.",
    "We should get reinforcements.",
    "What about other divisions of the Black Guard?",
    "What about a team of heroes?",
    "What about the trolls?",
    "Could the trolls make a difference?",
    "I don't know why they haven't got involved already.",
    "Why are you so scared of the trolls?",
    "Never mind.",
    "I'm going to go and talk to them, with or without you.",
    "I have to do something else.",
    "I have to do something else.",
    "I'd like to see you try to eat me!",
    "I need to talk to you.",
    "How can I prove I'm worthy?",
    "I'll just be going.",
    "We want you to help defend Keldagrim from chaos dwarves.",
    "Lots of chaos dwarves for you to eat.",
    "The dwarves of Keldagrim will be grateful.",
    "Colonel Grimsson made fun of your name.",
    "I'll just be going.",
    "Why do you have such a silly name?",
    "I'll just be going.",
    "What are you doing here?",
    "How's your Farming coming along?",
    "How can I get Pretty Flower to listen to me?",
    "But Pretty Flower was talking to me earlier!",
    "Pretty Flower is deaf?",
    "I'm not a crazy person!",
    "Wait, what pretty flower are you talking about?",
    "Mmm... soup.",
    "I thought you were talking about the warlord.",
    "Could I have a pretty flower?",
    "I'm making soup.",
    "I need to give it to Pretty Flower.",
    "*sigh*",
    "I need to give the plant to the warlord.",
    "Just give me the flower!",
    "Bye.",
    "I want something to remember you by.",
    "Bye.",
    "Bye.",
    "Bye.",
    "Bye.",
    "Take a look at this pretty flower...",
    "I thought you might want to make some soup.",
    "You see the flower? That's you, that is. Haha!",
    "It's a gift from Colonel Grimsson.",
    "Do you know where Veldaban is?",
    "Hello, Veldaban.",
    "Your Majesty.",
    "I don't understand how you ended up as king.",
    "Shouldn't your father, Dondakan, be king?",
    "Why didn't Meike make herself queen?",
    "What's happened to the Consortium now?",
    "Will you have the statue rebuilt with your head?",
    "So you're a king - what now?",
    "Plus you're not even the rightful king.",
    "What do you mean, what you're turning into?",
    "So what are you going to do?",
    "How do you think Veldaban is doing as king?",
    "Have you taken over Veldaban's job?",
    "Where is Veldaban?",
    "Do you need any help?",
    "I should go now.",
    "Did the wounded miners recover?",
    "Is the mine up and running again?"
  ],
  "Foreman Jack": [
    "It's magnificent isn't it? Just ... magnificent! All the mining companies pooled together to build this place. If you ever needed proof that the Consortium is good for Keldagrim, this is it.",
    "Wait, who's that? Hey! You there! You can't be in here without authorization!",
    "This is awful! Just ... awful! Sven! Quick, run to the palace and tell the Consortium what's happened. Human, please help us! We need to free those miners!",
    "You're alive!",
    "hank you, human! I'll look after the wounded if you just bring them to me.",
    "Are you alright?",
    "Thank Guthix you're here! There are still miners trapped! Hey! Where are you going?",
    "This is just ...",
    "He's unconscious, but he'll live.",
    "Is he... no, he'll be okay.",
    "She's dead! Dear Guthix. Please, human, there's one more miner. They might still be alive.",
    "Another one dead. This is awful. Just ... just awful. It's not your fault, human. I know you did all you could. You should go now. I'll look after the wounded and make sure the ... others get a proper burial."
  ],
  "Miner": [
    "Thank Guthix you're here, human. I can't walk... I think my legs are broken. if you carry me back to the foreman, I'll be okay.",
    "I'll live, thanks to this human.",
    "Where did you ...? Never mind, I'm just glad you're here. Get me to the foreman an I'll be fine.",
    "I'm ... I'm fine, I think... Just get everyone else out...please.",
    "Ugggh... thank you, human. I think I'm going to pass out now..."
  ],
  "Black Guard": [
    "Our orders are to get the machines working first. I'm sorry.",
    "Veldaban? You're under arrest on suspicion of involvement with the attack.",
    "Veldaban's been inciting violence against the Consortium. The company directors want him investigated. If you think he wasn't involved, you can come to the palace and defend him.",
    "If you saw something, you should come to the palace and tell the company directors. Maybe you'll be able to get your friend off the hook.",
    "S-sirs! Ma'am! Please forgive my interruption...",
    "Chaos dwarves! Our scouts have spotted a chaos dwarf army in the Barendir caverns.",
    "There's something else.",
    "There's a crowd outside the palace, at the east door. They're gathered around someone, he's making a speech.",
    "It's Hreidmar, the old head of the Red Axe. He's saying something about a king.",
    "Sirs! Ma'am! I mean... Your Majesty!",
    "News from Barendir! The chaos dwarf army has been routed by trolls!"
  ],
  "Protester": [
    "Down with the Consortium! Murderers! Consortium murders!"
  ],
  "Veldaban": [
    "Player! Over here!",
    "What are you doing here? No, never mind that. I heard there was a chaos dwarf attack. Was anyone hurt?",
    "I saw a Black Guard hazard squad go in here. Weren't they able to rescue the miners?",
    "What? Lieutenant Brae's in charge of the Black Guard now. She wouldn't leave people to die!",
    "Orders from the Consortium!",
    "Lieutenant Brae isn't like that, I'm sure.",
    "They must have had orders from the Consortium. I know the Consortium put profits ahead of people's lives, but they've never done it this blatantly! Well, this time the game's changed. When word spreads about this, I think we could be looking at a full-scale revolt.",
    "What? That's absurd!",
    "I'll go quietly, player, if you want to help me, come to the meeting room at the top of the palace and convince them I wasn't responsible.",
    "Don't, player! I'll go quietly. If you want to help me, come to the meeting room at the top of the palace and convince them I wasn't responsible.",
    "What are you talking about? I had nothing to do with it!",
    "Player! Tell these maniacs to let me go!",
    "Yes, what?",
    "Convince the company leaders to let me go!",
    "Talk to the company leaders. You'll have to get each of them on our side.",
    "The leaders all care about different things, so you'll need to take a different approach with each of them.",
    "Even if you think you've got one to agree with you, they might change their mind again if you say the wrong thing.",
    "Once you've talked to all of the leaders, talk to the general secretary.",
    "Because they can't take criticism!",
    "I've been speaking out against the Consortium. I've been telling people the truth! The Consortium happily let people die as long as they keep making money. There are a lot of people that agree with me.",
    "Now I've been proved right. There's an explosion in the Lava Flow Mine, and what do the companies do? Do they save the miners' lives? No! They fix the machine to keep their profits rolling in.",
    "But because I've been criticising the Consortium, they think I was involved in the attack!",
    "They let those miners die in order to save their machine! It's never been so blatant: the Consortium doesn't care about people, only profits.",
    "Oh, shut up.",
    "Gah! Alright, I'll try, if you think it'll help.",
    "Thank you. I... humbly accept your judgement.",
    "You stuck-up cave pigs! You had no right to keep me in the first place!",
    "Come on, Player. Let's get out of here.",
    "On, no... not Barendir, not again...",
    "You stuck-up... I mean, with respect, I urge you to reconsider.",
    "Talk to them again, Player! There's still time to change their minds.",
    "He's got them eating out of his hand.",
    "Listen, I know someone who might be able to help us: Meike, the leader of the Monarchist Society. We should find her. Maybe someone in the crowd knows where she is.",
    "No. That's why we came to see you.",
    "Player, what if it was Meike who got arrested? We should check at the Black Guard HQ.",
    "Lieutenant Brae, what's this man charged with?",
    "We badly need to find Meike. Klaas, if you'll tell us where she is, I'll see what I can do for you.",
    "Ah, well. For a charge like throwing stones, the Black Guard can't hold you for long anyway.",
    "And with the Black Guard stretched thin controlling the riots, you might not see another guard again for hours. Isn't that right, Lieutenant?",
    "So, for example, if someone were to take you into the slums and break both your legs for not giving them the information they need, they might never catch whoever did it.",
    "Thank you, you've been very helpful.",
    "Meike. You're not an easy person to find.",
    "We need your help. You're an expert on the monarchy. Down at the palace, Hreidmar is-",
    "He's a villain, Meike. He's kidnapping people, turning them into chaos dwarves. The chaos dwarf army is under his command.",
    "We've got to stop him. There must be something we can do.",
    "We can't. He's in plain view. The mob would tear Keldagrim apart, starting with us.",
    "He's been careful. We may know what he's up to, but we don't have strong evidence to tie the Red Axe to the chaos dwarves. It would be our word against his.",
    "We've got to stop Hreidmar. There must be something we can do.",
    "If only we could. No one can get in there.",
    "For Guthix's sake! This is no time for qualms!",
    "I'll see you at the library, Player.",
    "Let's get this door open. I think the crowd at the palace is getting agitated.",
    "Good work, Player!",
    "What's the matter?",
    "He altered the records. That's what we expected.",
    "Listen, Meike... Hreidmar cannot be allowed to take power. He's evil. It doesn't matter what the line of succession says.",
    "You wouldn't...",
    "Meike, I don't want... There must be some other way.",
    "Colonel Grenda is in charge of the Black Guard. We don't need to worry about that.",
    "Alright, Player. I can show you the way. Let me know when you're ready.",
    "Alright, Player. Meike's right, we should investigate the chaos dwarf army. Hreidmar won't need to be the rightful king if he can take over the city by force.",
    "Alright. Follow me.",
    "She meant that it's in Barendir; the chaos dwarf army is camped out in the Barendir caverns.",
    "And she's right. The thought of going back to that place...",
    "There was a battle there between the Black Guard and the trolls. The worst we'd had in decades. Tunnels were literally choked up with bodies.",
    "It's where Colonel Grimsson went beserk (sic) and got his scar. We all came away with scars, though, physical or psychological. The thought of going back there...",
    "But that's where the chaos dwarf army is, and that's where we've got to go if we want to stop them. Let's get it over with.",
    "I'll be in the Laughing Miner.",
    "I'm not a commander any more. I resigned from the Black Guard.",
    "*sigh* Just tell me what's happening, colonel.",
    "The Consortium's locked down, Lieutenant Brae's barely able to keep the city under control, and there's no help coming from Keldagrim.",
    "Convenient, aren't they? No need to bring torches into Barendir.",
    "Gods, I hate those crystals. Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle. It's like they're mocking all the death and pain that happened in these caves.",
    "We don't need to go that way, Player.",
    "That's troll country. Those caverns belong to Pretty Flower.",
    "Shh! Not so loud!",
    "Pretty Flower was the only troll warlord who survived the Battle of Barendir. Now he's the most powerful warlord in this area.",
    "His name strikes fear into the heart of every dwarf soldier. They say he wears a belt of dwarf skulls.",
    "Grimsson. You don't need to do this. Turn back your army.",
    "What happened to you, Grimsson? You were a harsh officer, but you were never cruel. We all looked up to you.",
    "You don't... you don't remember, do you? The Red Axe wiped your memory too!",
    "They've brainwashed you, Grimsson! You're even more brainwashed than me! Ha, ha, ha!",
    "You coward, Grimsson!",
    "Grimsson's abandoned his command post, but he'll have fallen back to a fortified position.",
    "I thought he'd have more honour than that. I should have known better.",
    "That would mean the two of us against the whole Red Axe army. I don't care how mighty a warrior you are, two of us against an army would be suicide.",
    "I'd like to believe you, but the size of his army suggests otherwise.",
    "That's a good idea, but where from?",
    "The Keldagrim Black Guard is tied up keeping the peace, and there's no easy way to recall the Black Guard from across the world.",
    "No, I think Colonel Grenda's First Division are the only Black Guard help we're going to get.",
    "This is an army we're dealing with, not a single enemy. I don't think any individual is going to make the difference we need.",
    "No! You're not really suggesting...",
    "Well, they could, if they entered on our side, but I don't see how you can arrange that. There's no predicting what the trolls will do.",
    "Neither do I, but I thank Guthix that they haven't.",
    "There's not been a major attack since the Battle of Barendir. We've kept out of these caves and Pretty Flower has left us alone. I worry that he's been building up an army to attack again, though.",
    "Grimsson must have been sensible enough not to antagonise them.",
    "Why aren't you? You must have met trolls before. They eat humans as well as dwarves.",
    "Alright, go. I'll be back at the Laughing Miner if you need me.",
    "If you want to go and talk to the trolls, you can do it without me. I'm staying here.",
    "I hope you've got the trolls on our side, Player.",
    "Meike's just told me how she... sorted out our problem with Hreidmar. It seems the records don't point to him after all.",
    "It's done now.",
    "There's someone coming onto the balcony.",
    "Guards! Arrest that man!",
    "Guards! I said arrest that man!",
    "Don't call me 'sir' any more, lieutenant. Call me 'Your Majesty'."
  ],
  "Sven": [
    "Please, everyone settle down. No one's allowed into the mine. There's nothing to see here!"
  ],
  "Green Gemstone director": [
    "We murdered two miners in order to get a machine running! How do we spin that?",
    "And what do you want, human? Can't you see we're busy?",
    "Yes, what do you want, human? Are you here to gawp at how dwarves care more about money than life? It's a good day for that.",
    "Veldaban's a known agitator against the Consortium. He's accused us of being in league with the Red Axe.",
    "I don't know if a trial will find him responsible for the attack, but we've got to keep him under guard until the crowd has died down.",
    "It's the single most important piece of machinery in Keldagrim, and I'm not going to tell its operational details to an outsider!",
    "I voted to save the miners! Not everyone around this table is a murderer, despite what you and Veldaban might think.",
    "Really? What happened?",
    "Yes, that's what we heard.",
    "I know! We ordered them to. Alright? The Consortium has blood on its hands. You don't need to remind me.",
    "Oh, thank Guthix. I wish more dwarves were like you.",
    "Look, I know you and Veldaban are allies. If you're both prepared to help us like that, then maybe we shouldn't get in your way.",
    "The human rescued some of the miners, which is more than anyone else here can say. If he will vouch for Veldaban, then I say we should let him go.",
    "If that's your attitude then I retract my decision.",
    "Have Colonel Grenda send the First Division to guard the caverns. Quickly!",
    "Veldaban, human, please... If there's anything you can do to calm that crowd outside down, please help us.",
    "If we let Veldaban go he'll portray us as monsters. We've got to keep him away from the crowds until we've got things under control.",
    "We still have to decide what to do with him. We need to discuss this further."
  ],
  "Brown Engine director": [
    "We had to do it. Didn't we? If we hadn't, then ...",
    "Sometimes I wish I'd never become a company director. I wish I hadn't had to make that decision. Those miners are dead and we could have saved them... but we had to do what we did.",
    "It was the Yellow Fortune director's idea. We have to manage public opinion, and Veldaban was having a negative effect on it.",
    "The Blue Opal director is the expert. You should ask him if you have any technical questions.",
    "I voted to save the machines. I mean we had to, didn't we? It's like the Blue Opal director says. More people would have died if we'd saved the miners instead. We did the right thing, didn't we?",
    "How can you say that so casually? You're as heartless as the other directors.",
    "Thank you, human. At least someone is prepared to be sensitive about this, rather than shouting. Listen, there's no point in keeping Veldaban detained. We don't have anything on him. I say we should let him go.",
    "I know...",
    "No, you...you can't take that tone with me! I'm a company director!",
    "I guess you saw first-hand what we did, then.",
    "We've done enough that's questionable today. We shouldn't add wrongful arrest. We should let Veldaban go.",
    "We can't put down a revolt at the same time as repelling a chaos dwarf invasion! We're doomed!",
    "We can't risk letting Veldaban go. We've got to keep him for the moment."
  ],
  "Blue Opal director": [
    "Of course we had to do it! We shouldn't need to spin this at all. If people just understood how the machines work!",
    "Idiots! Sentimental, soft-minded fools!",
    "We saved hundreds of lives. We did the right thing. If those people outside would listen for five minutes they'd understand.",
    "What? Oh, yes, him. You should talk to the Yellow Fortune director about that.",
    "Finally! Someone interested in the details of the problem!",
    "The lava comes from the sub-Barendir magma vent. Lava is siphoned off and runs along channels.",
    "Heat rising from the lava heats water in the primary boilers suspended over the lava channels.",
    "The resulting steam is channeled into the seven secondary boilers in the centre of the mine.",
    "From there, it's pushed through distribution vents to the various machines around Keldagrim. The mine carts, the Blast Furnace, and so forth. Everything relies on those distribution vents.",
    "No, no, no! It wouldn't have been able to get close enough to them. They're suspended over the lava!",
    "Yes! At least you're paying attention, not like these other idiots.",
    "Listen, you're clearly smarter than most of the mob out there. You're certainly smarter than some of these idiots on the Consortium.",
    "If you want us to release Veldaban into your care, that's what I'll recommend we do.",
    "Don't be stupid! The distribution vents run throughout the whole city. No single explosion could damage them all.",
    "I voted to repair the mine machinery, and you would have too if you understood how machines worked.",
    "If the power was down for more than a few minutes, it would go into complete shutdown and we wouldn't get it back up for days.",
    "The mine carts would stop running. We wouldn't be able to bring in food. People would starve.",
    "We couldn't afford to be sentimental. We had to let a couple of miners die in order to save hundreds of people.",
    "Then you would appreciate how bad the damage was and how important it was that we fix it right away!",
    "If we keep Veldaban under arrest we'll just find a way to bungle the situation further. If we let him go, maybe he and this human can help us.",
    "For Guthix's sake! What is it now?",
    "Veldaban, you're free to go. Get out of here.",
    "Veldaban and this human are clearly as stupid as some of you. We don't want them running around causing further harm. I say we keep Veldaban here."
  ],
  "Yellow Fortune director": [
    "They don't understand how the machines work, and they're hardly in the mood to learn! That's what you wanted, isn't it, Veldaban? You forced us to make this choice so that we look like murders.",
    "I said this would happen. We saved the city, but we look like murderers.",
    "We can hardly arrest the chaos dwarf. The Consortium must be seen to be taking action! Plus, Veldaban is a focus of anti-Consortium feeling. Getting him off the streets might slow the revolt down.",
    "He's a rabble-rouser. He's been stirring up feelings against the Consortium ever since he resigned from the Black Guard. But perhaps you're right. Arresting him could do more harm than good. If you promise to keep him under control then I think we should let him go.",

    "Leave me here to work. If I can't find something, then I might have to... Even if Hreidmar didn't alter the records, it might be possible...",
    "Veldaban, it might be the only way. We're all agreed. Hreidmar can't become king. Whatever it takes to stop that.",

Their avatar. When you defeat an avatar, you defeat the actual demon behind it. But they don't die, they are banished to where they came from originally.",
    "Doubtful. He will grow stronger and stronger over time, but that's a process that will take a thousand years at least. Even dwarves don't live so long. No, we won't see him again and the mines are safe to dig for gold now. Of course, that might lead to other problems eventually...",

    "After Alvis's death, the Consortium closed the records chamber and the six major company directors took a key each.",
    "As the Consortium expanded beyond six companies, the directors started arguing over who would keep the keys. Eventually they decided to lock all the keys together in the library.",
    "The records chamber has been opened a few times since then, at the Consortium's orders, but not often. I hear it might be opened again soon, which will be exciting!",
    "It's nice to have a chance to tell someone all that. No one's shown such an interest in the keys since that Hreidmar fellow, and that was about twenty years ago.",

You, I and Meike are the only people who know it isn't legitimate. This must stay our secret, Player. I never wanted this kind of power, but it was the only way to keep Hreidmar off the throne.",
    "The old rules of succession included a maximum age. Once the king reaches a hundred and fifty, the throne passes on to their heir.",
    "The monarchy was for men only and everyone knows that. No one would have believed the records if they had pointed to Meike.",

    "It doesn't seem right. Maybe one day, but not anytime soon.",
    "What now? Everything now! Everything, right now! The Consortium had eight leaders - they could divide responsibility between them. I'm just one dwarf. I spend most of my time judging disputes. Company leaders squabbling over who owns how much of some mine or factory; workers trying to get better treatment out of the companies... I let the workers unionise, and now the company leaders hate me. The Consortium is meant to advise me but I have to second-guess everything they say. Those are just the domestic problems. I'm also trying to negotiate a permanent peace treaty with the local trolls, over the objections of half the Black Guard officers who think a war would be good for their careers. Not to mention that Guthix is apparently dead and the actual GODS are back in Gielinor. Most dwarves can pretend it's not happening, but a head of state doesn't have that luxury. Gah! Listen to me! I don't like what I'm turning into, Player.",
    "Oh, don't give me that. Do you know how many of the old kings of Keldagrim were the first-born sons of their predecessors? Maybe half. At first, the 'rightful' king was whichever warlord held onto the throne long enough to put his son on it after him. Later it was whichever nobleman murdered everyone above him in the line of succession. Our worst kings have been spoiled children who inherited the kingdom then taxed it to starvation in order to decorate their palaces. That's what Hreidmar would be like, and that's why Meike put me on the throne - to protect the kingdom from him and his like.",
    "Back when I was Keldagrim Black Guard Commander, I'd rant about the Consortium for not allocating me enough resources. Now I'm the one having to turn down Lieutenant Brae's requests for more funding. I have to make every decision myself because I can't trust my advisors. Dwarves - civilians - are going to die because of decisions I make, and eventually there'll be so many dead that I'll stop caring, and then who will I be? Being king will turn me into either a tyrant, or a puppet for the Consortium. The transformation is inevitable.",
    "I can't focus on the other problems until I've dealt with the real threat - the Red Axe! I haven't heard anything from them since we foiled Hreidmar's last plot. Whatever they're doing, they're being secretive about it. This time I'm not going to wait for them to strike! I'm the King of Keldagrim, with the entire Black Guard under my command, and a new alliance with the trolls. I'm going to attack their base before they have time to move! I'm not ready quite yet, though. If you want to help, you should go and train your skills, to make sure you're prepared when the time comes."
