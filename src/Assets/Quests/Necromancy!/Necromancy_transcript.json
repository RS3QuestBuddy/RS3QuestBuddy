    "Go with you? Go where?",

    "I won't accept that. I won't stoop to his methods.",
    "Necromancy is magic using the souls of the dead, right?",
    "Enslaving those souls to do your bidding?",
    "Couldn't we just ask them nicely instead?",
    "Sounds like a plan to me.",
    "Are you from the city? Are you the only ones left?",
    "Can we do the same thing? Steal them back?",
    "How does that help?",
    "Don't worry, I'm going to be the good kind. I'll ask first.",
    "Yes, exactly!",
    "Then you don't have to, that's the whole point.",
    "Hi!",
    "Whoah, whoah. Remember we're doing this nicely. Do we have anything we can offer him in return?",
    "What about the city then. You're a necromancer, there must be something to learn in the Underworld.",
    "But no enslaving of souls!",
    "I'm going to ask the souls for permission.",

    "What? Why?",

    "What?",
    "That's right.",
    "Candles it is!",

    "The souls of this city languished in self-indulgence, slowly fading into nothingness.",
    "I have given them purpose. I will forge them into an army, and wage war upon the mortal world.",
    "Those who perish will also serve me, until the dead outnumber the living.",
    "When I am done, there will be no more need for death.",
    "I will set them free of their fear and doubt.",

    "On Gielinor at least. I have known him for a very long time.",
    "He only rarely leaves the Underworld. This plan of his to attack the living is new.",
    "Whenever he returns, he acts through others - those he calls his 'apprentices'.",
    "Yes. He has chosen you. When Angurvadal struck you down, you were marked.",
    "It is his twisted method of instruction. He has left you no choice but to learn necromancy.",

    "Of all my responsibilities, this is the only one I truly loathe. To enslave the dead is...despicable.",

    "Yes.",
    "Yes.",
    "Wha-",
    "You can't-",
    "I don't think anyone's ever tried that.",

    "Not from Rasial. We would need to assault his citadel, and you are not yet strong enough.",
    "But this is the City of Um. It exists to house lost souls. You could use a similar ritual to bring them here.",
    "As you said, a necromancer is empowered by the dead. The more souls you guide here, the more power you can wield.",
    "With enough power, you can defeat Rasial, rescue the stolen souls, and put an end to his plans.",
    "I know the Underworld like no other, but I am no necromancer. We will need a tutor.",
    "Malignius Mortifer...",
    "It is not your time. Sadly.",
    "You will instruct Player in the ways of necromancy.",
    "Have a care how you-",
    "I will not grant immortality to such a creature.",

    "They're waiting for you.",
    "Excellent. Things are progressing well. All of you, a word please...",
    "Before we talk, you should free up some room in your backpack.",
    "I cannot delay here any longer. This matter is crucial, but I have many other duties to attend to.",
    "In time, perhaps you can, but Rasial is immensely powerful.",
    "Perform more communion rituals to fill the Well of Souls.",
    "Do not neglect the practice of real combat - you will need that experience to unlock its true power.",
    "You can use the portal outside Draynor to return here.",
    "His patience is, if not infinite, extremely high. He has already made his move, and now he waits for yours.",

    "Some sort of dark ritual. He just sucked them all up into his lantern!",
    "You mean like...convince us to help you? Woo us?",
    "Well then, for what it's worth, I'm in.",
    "You know what would really set the mood?",
    "Candles! A few candles would really add a little 'I don't know what', as they say in Ardougne.",
    "Maybe if you just want any old spirit showing up so you can control it. I thought we were planning to befriend them.",

    "Is that you, Ted? I thought you got stolen away!",
    "It was the candles, right? See, I told you. Hey Ted, guess what this mortal is trying to do?",
    "Become a powerful necromancer without enslaving any souls.",
    "Sorry, no. Just ink and candles.",
    "Minions? That's offensive!",
    "Yeah, spirits.",
    "We don't sell ectoplasm, but my shop, Soul Supplies, sells ritual supplies like candles and necroplasm.",
    "Not ectoplasm, necroplasm! It's completely different. Well, I guess it's pretty similar actually when you get down to it.",

    "Is this...the fabled City of Um? The spirits told me of it, but I've never seen it.",
    "So much lost knowledge...the endless secrets!",
    "What are you talking about? How are you going to do necromancy?",
    "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. But if you want to do it the hard way, that's on you.",
    "Fine, you have a deal. What's first?",
    "Conjure a soul? Guide it to this city? Yes. Let's get started.",
    "We're going to need a suitable location, and this spot looks conveniently perfect. Has a necromancer been here recently?",
    "Er, right.",
    "Ritual sites vary in size and shape. More powerful necromancers can conduct larger rituals.",
    "So we'd better just try a makeshift communion ritual for now.",
    "You need to sweep away all the dust before we can start.",
    "Allergies. Just do the inner area for now.",
    "*achoo* That's better. Now, listen carefully.",
    "First, you place a focus on the pedestal to determine the ritual.",
    "A focus is an item placed on the central pedestal. Which item depends on the ritual - communion rituals require bones, for example.",
    "Then, the surrounding tiles will be perfect for drawing the required glyphs. Different rituals require different glyphs.",
    "We have no need for candles. Only the glyphs are required.",
    "Fine, we'll use the pentagon shaped tiles for the candles.",
    "...",
    "There's also some chanting, but let's just take it one step at a time.",
    "For a communion ritual, you'll need bones as your focus. You can use these.",
    "I'm a necromancer. Wouldn't it be stranger if I wasn't?",
    "Talk to me again when you have free space for these ritual supplies.",
    "Place the bones onto the pedestal.",
    "I suppose you'd better place the...candles next.",
    "Now, the glyphs. To draw them we'll need ink, and I don't know where we'll find some...",
    "As I was saying, we now need to draw the required glyphs.",
    "The specific spot doesn't matter, as long as you draw the correct number and type of glyphs required for your chosen ritual.",
    "Glyphs and candles will degrade with each ritual. If they deplete, you'll need to repair or replace them.",
    "I see a depleted glyph there already. It must have been left from the last ritual.",
    "You can repair it with the same supplies you need to draw it in the first place.",
    "Everything *looks* to be in order.",
    "Now everything's prepared, go and stand on the skull platform over there.",
    "I can't believe you managed to get it right on your first attempt.",
    "Where did the soul go, though?",
    "A vessel! With this you could grow truly powerful. We should perform more rituals!",
    "The communion ritual will guide souls into this vessel. The more souls that reside within, the more power you can tap into.",
    "If you want to channel and direct that power, though, you'll need to practice your skills in real combat.",
    "If you want to fight, you'll need what we in the trade call a 'siphon'. You don't have one do you, skeleton?",
    "Talk to me again when you have free space for this equipment.",
    "A death guard! Excellent.",
    "Weapons like these channel necrotic power into powerful attacks, while protecting you from any backlash.",
    "We must test your newfound power.",
    "Equip that death guard and attack them!",
    "And that's how it's done!",
    "If you want to conjure a spirit, you'll need a 'conduit' - something that can connect you to this vessel wherever you are.",
    "You there, ghost person. Do you...?",
    "Talk to me again when you have free space for this equipment.",
    "Conduits like this lantern allow you to communicate with your minions.",
    "Err...friends?",
    "It's not. The connection is magical. It's not a trumpet.",
    "Conjuring spirits, like your skeleton warrior, requires a material known as ectoplasm.",
    "It's not hard to find - you'll accumulate some as a side effect of every ritual you perform.",
