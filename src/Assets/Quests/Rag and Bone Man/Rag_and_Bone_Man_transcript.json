    "Can I help you with something?",
    "Err...",
    "I'm an archeologist and I work with the museum.",
    "Yes.",
    "Err...",
    "I'm collecting bones for the museum. They've asked me to rig up some displays of Second and Third Age creatures, using their bones, so that people can come and, well, look at them. I need to get them into some sort of order before I begin, but I've run into a bit of a snag.",
    "Well, I need to have all the bones I'm going to use here first, then I've got to put them in some sort of order. I seem to be a few bones short of a skeleton, though.",
    "Errr...",
    "What mumbling? I have enough problems of my own without having to deal with a delusional adventurer.",
    "Err...",
    "There is something you could do for me. I'm going to be busy, er ...",
    "Sorting! Yes, sorting these bones out ready for the museum. I still need a few more, though.",
    "Will you help me out?",
    "You will? Excellent!",
    "Dig?",
    "Oh, you must have got the wrong end of the stick. I need some fresh, whole bones to replace ones that have become damaged.",
    "Err...",
    "Okay, got it. Here's the thing: while sorting out, what bones I do have I managed to lose or damage a few. If you can get me some fresh, unbroken bones to use as replacements, then I can get on with things. Does that make things clearer?",
    "Great. If you can get me a bone from a goblin, a bear, a big frog, a ram, a unicorn, a monkey, a giant rat and a giant bat, then I'll be able to move on with the, er...",
    "...displays.",
    "Well, I wouldn't mind you boiling them in vinegar first, if you don't mind. There is a wine merchant in Draynor called Fortunato who sells the stuff you'll need. You can even use my pot boiler if you want.",
    "It gets them bright and sparkling white... It's an archeologist thing. Just put the bone in a pot of vinegar, throw some logs on the fire, put the pot on the boiler, then light the logs. It takes a short while for the vinegar to evaporate, but the bone will be nice and clean in the end.",
    "Bye!",
    "Have you brought me any bones?",
    "Sure.",
    "You still need to bring me a goblin bone. Goblins are relatively common. In fact, I hear there is a house full of them in Lumbridge.",
    "You still need to bring me a bear bone. I hear there are some bears over by the Legends' guild, near Ardougne.",
    "You still need to bring me a big frog bone. This one might be a little tricky. You'll need to go into the Lumbridge Swamp Dungeon. Don't forget to take a light source! Never forget your light source down there.",
    "You still need to bring me a ram bone. I'm sure you will be able to find a ram wherever there are sheep.",
    "You still need to bring me a unicorn bone. I seem to remember seeing some unicorns south of Varrock. I think they might still be there.",
    "You still need to bring me a monkey bone. Monkeys tend to live in jungles, like those on Karamja. I think they are pretty plentiful there, if I can remember correctly.",
    "You still need to bring me a giant rat bone. If you can't find one in a sewer, then you might want to try looking in some caves.",
    "You still need to bring me a giant bat bone. Giant bats tend to live underground, but I have heard there are a few near the coal trucks in Kandarin.",
    "Did you get all that?",
    "Don't forget to boil them in vinegar first. Just chuck some logs into the pit, put the bone into the pot of vinegar and drop it into the pot boiler. Then light the logs and wait for the vinegar to boil away.",
    "Great! Let me take a look at them. That's the last of them! The museum will be thrilled to know I've completed the collection.",
    "You've been a big help and no mistake. I'm always on the lookout for fresh bones, so if you see any of the ones on my wish list, bring them right over. I have it pinned to the outside of my shack whenever you want to check it."

    "Well, err... who are you and what are all these bones doing here?",
    "An archeologist?",
    "Well, that explains the bones - sort of - but what are you doing all the way out here?",
    "What sort of snag?",
    "Where is that mumbling coming from?",
    "Anything I could do to help?",
    "Yes, I'll give you a hand.",
    "Where do you need me to dig?",
    "What?",
    "Excuse me?",
    "Sorry...",
    "Well, it makes some sense I suppose...",
    "So you just want me to bring you these bones and that will be that?",
    "Why do I need to boil them in vinegar?",
    "Alright, I'll be back later.",
    "Not at the moment. Can you give me a rundown on which bones I have left to give?",
    "Yes, I'll get right on it.",
    "Okay, I'll remember.",
    "Have you got any vinegar?",
    "Sorry, I was told to come and speak with a wine merchant about getting some vinegar. I must have the wrong person.",
    "If by 'he' you mean the old man with the sack of bones, then yes.",
    "I have some bones for you.",
    "Well, I'm glad I could help.",
    "No problem. I'll be sure to bring you anything you might like. I can't wait to see the displays once they are finished."
