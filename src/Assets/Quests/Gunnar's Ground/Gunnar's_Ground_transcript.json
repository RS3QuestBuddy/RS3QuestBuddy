    "'My heart with burdens heavy does it lie.' 'For never did I...' Um...",
    "You're a poet too?",
    "Ah! Then I'm sure you can identify with the arduous state of my life.",
    "Oh. Then maybe you can identify with the arduous state of my life.",
    "Oh. How can I expect you to identify with the arduous state of my life?",
    "My heart is stricken with that most audacious of maladies!",
    "Love! The walls of my heart are besieged by love's armies, and those walls begin to tumble!  In the barbarian village lives the fairest maiden I have ever witnessed in all my life.",
    "I wouldn't know where to start! Her fiery spirit? Her proud bearing? Her winsome form?",
    "The people of this village value strength, stature and riches. I have none of these things. My people are indomitable warriors, dripping with gold and precious gems, but not I. I am not built for combat, and poetry has proven a life of poverty!",
    "You see!",
    "If Gudrun could ever love a dwarf, surely she would need to see my artisanry. Will you help me? I am no crafter of metal.",
    "I need a ring of purest gold. Then we can engrave it with the words of my heart. Oh! I know the perfect place to get a gold ring. Edgeville's metalsmith, Jeffery, labours like myself under the weight of unrequited love. Perhaps, if you took one of my love poems to Jeffery, he would trade it for a gold ring.",
    "By all means.",
    "Yes! Jeffery's rings are timeless works of incomparable romantic splendour.",
    "North of here, beyond a ruined fortress. It used to be a bustling den of cutthroats but it's quite quiet these days.",
    "Some time ago, Jeffery asked me for advice in acting on his affections. I gave him the best advice that I could. Things didn't work out very well for him. One thing led to another and now he no longer wishes to speak to me.",
    "These love poems are written in the Misthalinian style. A noble barbarian maiden would be insulted, not flattered.",
    "Oh no, nothing like that! I have the words, I just need your help with the tools.",
    "'I await in eagerness for a loop of lustrous grandeur.' No, that just sounds ridiculous. Have you brought me a ring from Jeffery?",
    "Thank you! That's exactly what I need! Now, would you engrave something on it for me?",
    "I've given this some thought. 'Gudrun the Fair, Gudrun the Fiery.'",
    "Just use a chisel on the gold ring.",
    "Yes, here you go.",
    "I've seen jewelcrafters use them for all sorts of precise work.",
    "Is it done? Have you created a work of magnificent beauty?",
    "You seem to already have one.",
    "Is it done? Have you created a work of magnificent beauty?",
    "You're right! It's perfect!",
    "Brilliant! That's perfect!",
    "I don't know what you mean: it's perfect!",
    "Will you do one more thing for me?",
    "I fear she will only judge this poor book by its cover. Would you take the ring to Gudrun for me?",
    "Please don't tell her I'm a dwarf just yet.",
    "Inside the barbarian village.",
    "Please take the ring to Gudrun for me.",
    "Did you give Gudrun the ring? What did she think?",
    "Oh no!",
    "Did you give Gudrun the ring? What did she think? Did it capture her heart?",
    "It's because I'm a dwarf, isn't it? Or because I'm a poet? I knew it! I'm completely worthless!",
    "Oh! Then what's the problem?",
    "Sorry! Most cruel is fate! Most cruel! Why not?",
    "This village has stood for a hundred years!",
    "Really? Interesting.",
    "Not really. I talked with Hunding, who guards this tower here. An idea occurs to me, but it is hubris of the greatest magnitude.",
    "An idea occurs to me, but it is hubris of the greatest magnitude.",
    "What if I wrote a poem? Forged a sweeping, historical epic? Crafted a tale to touch the chieftain's soul?",
    "To win the heart of my beloved from her father's iron grasp? It is worth it just to try!",
    "'Even the bloodiest rose must settle.' Mixed metaphor. What settles? Detritus. That's hardly flattering. 'Even the rolliest boulder...'",
    "I'm stuck! I'm a worthless wordsmith! My work is pointless! My life is pointless!",
    "I'm stuck on a word. By the colossus of King Alvis! I can't find the words!",
    "I don't know! I'm not some kind of word scientist. I just feel it out as I go. Maybe you could suggest some words to get me started. Then I can tell you more.",
    "That doesn't really fit. It needs to be one syllable long.",
    "That doesn't really fit. It needs to rhyme with the word 'day'.",
    "That doesn't really fit. It needs to mean something like 'wandering aimlessly'.",
    "'And from his righteous purpose never stray.' That fits! It fits perfectly. Right meaning, right length, right rhyme. Well done!",
    "The poem still isn't finished, though. I have another missing word. Give me another one; anything, to get me started.",
    "That doesn't really fit. It needs to be one syllable long.",
    "That doesn't really fit. It needs to mean something like 'danger'.",
    "That doesn't really fit. It needs to rhyme with the word 'yet'.",
    "'But long is gone the author of that threat.' Perfect! Yes!",
    "It's coming together. We're nearly done! One more to go! This one is tricky, though. It's a phrase I need. Someone did something.",
    "That doesn't really fit. It needs to rhyme with the word 'lore'.",
    "That doesn't really fit. It needs to imply some aggressive action, like 'started a fight'.",
    "That doesn't really fit. It needs to be three syllables long.",
    "'Who then, in face of madness, swept to war.' At last! It's done! It's finished! My finest work! Thank you so much for your help!",
    "What? No! I'm a writer, not a performer. I think the chieftain would respond best to one of his people. Perhaps you could ask Gudrun to recite it to her father?",
    "My poem is terrible, isn't it? The chieftain will probably have me killed.",
    "How long have they been in there?",
    "This isn't going to work.",
    "What was I thinking? You should go in there and stop them before Gudrun makes a fool of herself.",
    "No! Wait, stay here, it's too late now. We'll just have to see how it turns out.",
    "You're right, it's too late now. We'll just have to see how it turns out.",
    "I can't hear what's happening. Can you hear what's happening?",
    "He's probably considering the various tortures he has planned for me.",
    "The poem says you can honour your ancestors by settling peacefully on the land they conquered. He'll probably find it insulting.",
    "I hope they at least give me a decent burial.",
    "Um, that would be me. Hello.",
    "Uh, yes.",
    "Sorry.",
    "I'm more than a little surprised! He even gave me a house to live in!",
    "It's huge!",
    "I think Gunthor wants to keep me close, but not too close. Oh, I found something there for you! Whoever lived there before left a dozen pairs of boots in the attic. I picked out a pair for you to thank you for all your help. Underneath them all was this magic lamp. You should have it as well!",
    "Yes, we'll see you there!",
    "Goodbye!",
    "Goodbye!"

    "I recognise his awful handwriting.",
    "That cheeky little... He can't just leave it alone, can he? Fine! I'll trade you for the poem. What is it you want?",
    "Well, all I have is this plain, gold ring. That will have to do.",

    "Alright, how about, uh...",

    "He thinks all your people are our enemies.",
    "I suppose that might work.",
