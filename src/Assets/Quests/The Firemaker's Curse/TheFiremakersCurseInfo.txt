Light one of the oil pools on the wall.`
Avoiding being damaged by the fire balls. You can light the oil pool lines as a barricade. You must last all the waves which is approximately 10 minutes. If you stay in the north-west corner and immediately light the oil pools as soon as they're ready you should stay safe.` 
There is no guarantee however. If the fire balls start congregating on one side, run to opposite corner, placing a barricade behind you. Another tactic is to use the right click option on the oil pools and use 'right' and 'left' to perform a clockwise rotation of the edges of the pit.`

Climb down the steps to enter Char's lair.`
Talk to Char to engage the fight.`
During the fight, you should keep a distance from Char at all times.`
The amount of damage you deal is determined by the amount of flames you have lit (100 damage per active flame).`
As you fight her, keep lighting flames.`
A simple strategy to defeat Char follows:`
Add your pitch can to your ability bar to make fires much more easily`
Run around the edges of the arena lighting flames as fast as you can.`
When you have 10 active flames, run some distance from Char and attack her a few times, dealing 1,000-5,000 damage in total.`
Repeat steps 1-2 until she is defeated.`
Remember to avoid the firewalls by maneuvering through the gaps, or you'll be hit for 1,000-4,000 damage.`
While Char is glowing she is invincible, so focus on lighting flames during this period.`
After the battle ends, talk to Char. (Chat 2)`
There may be a glitch where you can not finish the dialogue, in that case leave the cave through the southern tunnel and come back in.
Exit through the tunnel to the north.`
