Speak to Golrie in the Gnome Village Dungeon. (Chat 2•✓•4) (Note: If you run into a bug where you can't click the X to close the letter without it moving your character, right-click on the X and click "Close" or press "Esc" on your keyboard to close the note.)`
After asking what is next, you will be transported to the surface for a conversation with Golrana.`
Teleport to Castle Wars (or follow Elkoy out of the maze) and head to the highlighted area north of the Observatory and south of the Ourania altar (just north-east of the crystal tree).`
Make sure to pass the Observatory on its eastern side, alternatively use a 'Chipped' Watchtower teleport to teleport directly there.`
Make sure to dismiss your pet/follower. Talk to Golrana. (Chat 1)`
Walk up the path north-west until you reach a large dead tree. Search it, then climb-through it.`
Investigate the ledge on the south end of the chasm and continue through the cave.`
Move south and continue through the cave by jumping across gaps.`
Travel north-west until reaching a water stream with stepping stones, but do not cross yet.`
Before crossing the set of stepping stones, investigate the small crevice in the south wall to your immediate east.`
Cross the stepping stones, head southwest until you reach a crevice, then climb-through and out of the cave.`
Go west to the ledge overlooking Lletya and investigate the sturdy tree, then climb-down it.`
After a cutscene, take the handwritten book on the crate next to you and read it.`
Search all crates, lamps, shelves and the picture in the room. You will be notified when you have gathered everything in the room.`
Build the crate at the desk north of the ladder, then calibrate it.`
Note down the number and colour value for all three.`
Use The Color Calculator Provided at the top-----
Clear any Skybox filters to see the plain colours for this next part.-----
To change the colour, rotate the prism near the singing bowl until it reaches the desired colour.-------
To change the sides it goes from empty which is 1 side to full which is 6 sides. Each right-click "Fill" adds 1 side`
To finalise the crystal into the shape, sing-glass on the singing bowl.-----
To obtain more minute crystal seeds, search the crate just next to the bowl.`
Once you sing all 6 desired shapes, calibrate the device then insert the correct shapes into their corresponding slots.`
Click the green tick mark at the bottom to complete the puzzle.`
Climb up the ladder and talk to Golrana underneath the steps just to the east of Lletya centre. (Chat 1) (If you teleport to Lletya instead of leaving via the ladder, she will not appear. You can return to the lab from a trapdoor in the sheep pen in the northwest Lletya.)`
Once back up on the ledge, walk past the large boulder to the east, and Golrana should spot an air vent.`
Open the air vent on the rock wall opposite of the boulder, then climb-down it.`
Climb-up the stairs just next to you.`
Head east to the prison and rotate the watcher once.`
Enter the prison through the metal doors. Talk to the guard. (Chat ~•~)`
Pick-lock on the northwest cell door. Talk to Bolrie. (Chat 1•2•3•3•1)`
Lead Bolrie out of the jail and southwest through the corridor.`
Continue through the door in the end and watch the cutscene.`
After the cutscene, stand north of the big boulder and push it southward to block the air vent.`
Talk to the gnomes for a cutscene.`
Talk to them again to watch a second cutscene.`
