  "TzHaar-Xil-Tog": [
    "What you want, [Title]-[Caste]-Player?",
    "I tell you what happened! Big creature dug tunnels under TzHaar city and TzHaar-Xil-Tog will kill it!",
    "We are strong enough!",
    "You big champion. You save TzHaar from TokHaar.",
    "Leave fate of city in hands of JalYt?",
    "Fine, but make sure you kill TokTz-Ket-Dill, too, so it does not dig more tunnels.",
    "Are you not [Title]-[Caste]?",
    "That what you are...you tough and strong, no?",
    "That what you are...you agile and quick, no?",
    "That what you are...you user of mystic powers, no?",
    "That what you are...you skilled at making things, no?",
    "And you are JalYt no longer. You are TzHaar now.",
    "Then you [Title]-[Caste]!",
    "Poor JalYt.",
    "I am TzHaar-Xil, one of the hunters for the city. We battle volcanic monsters and provide food and supplies for all TzHaar. There are also the wise TzHaar-Mej who guide us, the mighty TzHaar-Ket who guard us, and the skilled TzHaar-Hur who craft our homes and tools.",
    "Well, then. There is no problem.",
    "Whatever you say, JalYt!",
    "Then it is an honour to speak with you, TzHaar-[Caste]-Player. You great and powerful TzHaar, and defender of our city.",
    "I heard you are modest, TzHaar-[Caste]-Player. No need. Revel in our praise. You deserve all honour.",
    "Are tunnels fixed and TokTz-Ket-Dill killed?",
    "TzHaar-Xil-Tog is impressed, [Title]-[Caste]-Player. I did not take you for a hunter."

  "Player": [
    "What has happened here?",
    "A...TokTz-Ket...Dill, eh? I met some of those on my journey to the Kiln. Big claws, stone plate armour? Right?",
    "A...TokTz-Ket...Dill, eh? A big lava monster?",
    "You mean...an armadillo? In the volcano?",
    "Haha. I always thought TzHaar ate rocks.",
    "I see. Well, why don't you just clear the rubble, then? You look strong enough for the job.",
    "Can't you just fill the tunnels with rocks or something?",
    "Hmm. Maybe I'm small enough to fit through? And I'm more than capable when it comes to constructing things, so I should be able to repair the tunnels, as well.",
    "I defeated the leader of the TokHaar. A mere TokTz-Ket-Dill should be no match for me.",
    "Alright, I can do that.",
    "Oh, that's a shame. Well, I hope it works out for you.",
    "Well, yes, I suppose I am...",
    "Nothing.",
    "I'm here to help stabilise the tunnels under the city and kill the beast that dug them. The TzHaar over there told me to talk to you as you're the guard of the tunnel entrance.",
    "I've already saved your city once, you know. All that business with the Ga'al and the TokHaar? That was me. Plus, I'm small enough to get through the crack.",
    "But I'm the only one small enough to get through the crack.",
    "I'm very good at Construction and could easily repair a few tunnels.",
    "Hmm. Alright, what do I need?",
    "What? Could you say that in...you know, non-TzHaar?",
    "I'm sure I could get what I need, but I don't understand what the words mean.",
    "But then how will I be able to help you?",
    "Nothing.",
    "I don't understand this list. I recognise the symbols as numbers I found in an old journal, but I don't understand the words.",
    "I don't understand this list. It has some weird symbols on it and words in TzHaar.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Sorry, but could you tell me again where you got these...uh...\"books\" from?",
    "I've got this list of various items I need to gather, but there are a bunch of weird characters and words I can't understand. TzHaar-Ket-Grol wasn't very helpful in translating, so he sent me here to study.",
    "Yes, it is. So, would you help me?",
    "Alright, and where is the JalYt section?",
    "Er...it looks to me like that bookcase is filled with ashes.",
    "But...they are actual ashes, not books.",
    "Okay, let's call them books. So...how do you read them? I mean, they're ash- er, books.",
    "But that's not what we use. We use books. Paper. And we write on it.",
    "Ah, I think I understand now. The books must've been burnt when they were brought into the volcano.",
    "No, I mean...er...nevermind. Anyway, maybe you know what these words mean?",
    "Fine. Well, can you at least tell me where you got the book from? Whoever wrote them must know.",
    "Alright, thank you.",
    "A TzHaar library, eh? I didn't know the TzHaar had libraries. Or knew how to read, for that matter.",
    "How come the bookcases in the back are full of ashes?",
    "How are you supposed to read ashes?",
    "Alright...well, I'm off now. Bye.",
    "No, thanks.",
    "Hello, Reldo. I've just been in the library down in the TzHaar city where I found the ashes of a book-",
    "Oh no, not at all. The heat from the volcano caused them to burn and the TzHaar simply think that the ashes are what we humans read.",
    "Anyway, one of the books apparently contained a dictionary of some sort. I have a couple of words and characters in TzHaar that I need translating. The TzHaar librarian couldn't help me, so I figured I'd go to the person who sent them the books \u2013 namely you.",
    "Alright, I'll get looking then. Thank you.",
    "Hello, Reldo. Could you remind me where I could find that book on the TzHaar language?",
    "Alright, thank you.",
    "I read this book that told me a bit about the TzHaar language, so I know what to bring now.",
    "First, I need a pickaxe.",
    "Some oak planks. I need to have a TzHaar treat them to make them resistant to fire.",
    "Finally, I need some blocks of stone. The kind you use come from your own mines, so that's where I should get them as well.",
    "Alright, thank you.",
    "Nothing at all.",
    "I've forgot what I was supposed to do now.",
    "Nothing.",
    "Can I go in here?",
    "What are you guarding here?",
    "How come? Is there some sort of top secret project going on beyond this tunnel?",
    "Ah, I see.",
    "Nothing at all.",
    "Can you treat these oak planks for me? I need them to be fire-resistant before I can start repairing the tunnels.",
    "Here you go.",
    "I've changed my mind.",
    "No, not yet.",
    "Who are you?",
    "It doesn't seem to be the most active place to guard.",
    "Haha. Boring job and ungrateful clients. That's just wonderful.",
    "I see. So if I ever want the gossip, I should come to you then?",
    "I'll keep that in mind, thank you.",
    "No, thanks.",
    "Who are you?",
    "Did you say...play writer?",
    "I didn't know the TzHaar did theatre...",
    "I see. Well, good luck with that.",
    "How come you're just standing around here when everyone else is busy mining?",
    "Then maybe you could teach me magma mining?",
    "That sounds rather pointless.",
    "You are the only TzHaar I've ever met who has even mentioned TzHaar plays.",
    "Can you teach me magma mining?",
    "I'm sure they will.",
    "You have fun, then.",
    "Oh, alright.",
    "I've been told I have to learn how to safely mine through magma, and I also need access to your mines here to get some rocks for a repair. Maybe you could teach me?",
    "But you don't look very busy and one of the TzHaar guards told me I should come here to learn.",
    "But it's very important! I need to learn so that I can enter the tunnels below the city and repair the damage caused by some big rodent. If I don't, the tunnels risk collapsing, destroying the TzHaar city!",
    "The entrance into the tunnels is too narrow for a TzHaar to get through, that's why they asked me to do it.",
    "But of course you want something for your trouble...",
    "Alright, what do you need? Four buckets and a piece of clay? Five iron ore and a rare feather from a long lost species of birds? Any dangerous beasts in trap-filled dungeons you need slaying?",
    "Hmm. And how do you suggest we go about doing that? Convincing ANYONE that theatre can be good is a challenge. I don't think convincing a TzHaar will be any easier.",
    "No! No! Not like that.",
    "Okay, so what is the plot of the story?",
    "Doesn't sound too bad, I suppose. I'll see what I can do.",
    "What if I pay you? I could probably scrape together some TokKul to make it worth your trouble.",
    "Oh no! Not like that at all. But alright, if you don't want TokKul, maybe I can help you out with something?",
    "Fine, I'll go somewhere else.",
    "No, I'm fine, thanks.",
    "Could you give me some hints on how to make them all happy with the play?",
    "Alright, I'll keep that in mind. Thank you.",
    "Could you tell me about the miners' relations? Who likes who, and so on.",
    "I've changed my mind. I don't want to know about any of them.",
    "Could you tell me what the miners' current moods are?",
    "No, thanks.",
    "It was going well for a while, but I seem to have made some changes to the plot that were highly unpopular.",
    "Alright, I will start working from there again.",
    "What is the current plot of the story?",
    "I think the plot could do with some changes.",
    "I don't think anyone should get killed. All the villain should do is rob or the play might send across the wrong signals.",
    "How about this? The second human this evil TzHaar attacks is a strong warrior. It could be someone who's been training with the Void Knights for months! Anyway, so the TzHaar attacks another human and the human pulls out an abyssal whip and defeats the TzHaar.",
    "What? Have you been outside of the mines recently? Humans are very capable fighters.",
    "Maybe unprovoked violence from a TzHaar isn't the best way to start the story. What if the humans who get killed were killed in self defence? Then this first kill could spark a hunger in the TzHaar, which drives him to commit more crimes.",
    "It may not be a good idea to pit the TzHaar directly against each other. What if the crimes are only directed at humans? The play could show how the TzHaar act together to stop the criminal in order to keep the peace with the other races.",
    "I think the TzHaar would find it more interesting if it was only about them and didn't have any humans involved.",
    "I've got good news, TzHaar-Hur-Brekt. All the miners are happy with the plot now, so we can move on and start handing out the roles.",
    "I've still got some stuff to do.",
    "Hmm. I'll talk to TzHaar-Hur-Brekt and see what I can do.",
    "Why don't you like theatre?",
    "But something good can always come out of it. A play could very well take up real issues and demonstrate them in a safe and educational way.",
    "I should probably try to find an overall storyline that more of them are at least somewhat comfortable with before I start trying to make small changes.",
    "How can I make the story better for you?",
    "Nevermind, then.",
    "Nevermind, then.",
    "What if the rich character in the story is a TzHaar-Hur? When the criminal robs it, it discovers its identity and uncovers its reign of terror.",
    "Hmm. Maybe this wasn't too good after all.",
    "So you want one of the characters to be a TzHaar-Hur? How about the TzHaar who gets assaulted in its home? It could have been because the criminal wanted to get its hands on the TzHaar-Hur's fine creations.",
    "I don't know how to.",
    "Nevermind",
    "Hmm. I'll talk to TzHaar-Hur-Brekt and see what I can do.",
    "Why don't you like theatre?",
    "But as far as I understand, mining isn't part of your caste role, either?",
    "I should probably try to find an overall storyline that more of them are at least somewhat comfortable with before I start trying to make small changes.",
    "How can I make the story better for you?",
    "What if one of the characters is a TzHaar-Mej, but, even though it is an organiser and leader, it is not sure of who the criminal is?",
    "Alright, I'll see if I can think of something else.",
    "What if one of the characters is a TzHaar-Mej who is aware of the whole situation, even who the criminal is, but for some reason keeps it to himself?",
    "Thank you. We're geting somewhere now.",
    "I can't think of anything.",
    "Okay, no more changes.",
    "What if the whole thing was just a plot staged by a mastermind TzHaar-Mej who wanted to test the loyalty of the local TzHaar?",
    "What if all the crimes are planned by an evil TzHaar-Xil and the TzHaar-Mej are unaware of it because the TzHaar-Xil has been a good TzHaar up until this point?",
    "Hmm. Fine, I will see if I can think of something else.",
    "I can't think of anything.",
    "No, thanks.",
    "Hmm. I'll talk to TzHaar-Hur-Brekt and see what I can do.",
    "Why don't you like theatre?",
    "What is it that makes the Fight Pit exciting?",
    "I should probably try to find an overall storyline that more of them are at least somewhat comfortable with before I start trying to make small changes.",
    "How can I make the story better for you?",
    "Oh yeah, I'd already talked to you about that.",
    "What if we make the smart and stealthy criminal a TzHaar-Xil?",
    "Alright, that's great. We're really getting somewhere now. I should talk to TzHaar-Hur-Brekt about this.",
    "No, sorry, but I don't think there is room for a TzHaar-Xil among the characters.",
    "What if the criminal is a TzHaar-Xil who does what it does to prove their superiority? As a result, the TzHaar-Xil could be recognised as the military leaders of the TzHaar.",
    "Glad I could be of help, but the others don't seem too happy about this.",
    "What if the criminal is a TzHaar-Ket? It would show that they don't have as much self-control as they'd like to think.",
    "Oh. Well, I will try to think of something else, then.",
    "Sorry, but I can't think of anything to fix that.",
    "Nevermind.",
    "Hmm. I'll talk to it and see what I can do.",
    "Why don't you like theatre?",
    "But then your role doesn't include mining?",
    "But then why can't you play or watch theatre when you get old?",
    "Why is it stupid, then? Surely, it can at least be entertaining.",
    "How can I make the story better for you?",
    "I should probably try to find an overall storyline that more of them are at least somewhat comfortable with before I start trying to make small changes.",
    "How can I make the story better for you?",
    "Alright.",
    "What if one of the characters is a TzHaar-ket who is aware of the whole situation, even who the criminal is, but decides not to stop it for some reason?",
    "Alright, I guess that makes sense. I'll see if I can come up with something else.",
    "What if a TzHaar-Ket discovers who the criminal is, and then captures and punishes it?",
    "Sorry, but I can't think of anything that would change that.",
    "No, thanks.",
    "The story TzHaar-Hur-Brekt has written is about a TzHaar called TokTz-Ket-Ek-Mack who has gone against TzHaar society and becomes a criminal. Its crime wave starts when a human visits the TzHaar city and ends up killed, and then the events escalate from there. TokTz-Ket-Ek-Mack starts stealing from other TzHaar, kills another human visitor, and even assaults TzHaar in their homes. This smart criminal always manages to evade the arm of the law and never gets caught. The play is meant to show how chaotic life would be if the TzHaar didn't follow their rules. So, what do you think about it?",
    "Hmm. I guess I need to talk to TzHaar-Hur-Brekt about some changes, then.",
    "TzHaar-Hur-Brekt and I have made some changes, and the story is now about a TzHaar called TokTz-Ket-Ek-Mack who has gone against the TzHaar society and becomes a criminal.

It continues to rob humans but also other TzHaar, and even assaults TzHaar in their homes, but it never gets caught.

I think we need to make just a few more changes before everyone is pleased now.",
    "We should decide an ending.",

    "I don't think it's good that one TzHaar outsmarts all the others and gets away with it flawlessly. I think such severe actions deserve a severe punishment, so it should get caught and killed.",

    "Bah, no good. Was there anything else?",
    "Awful! No TzHaar-Ket would ever let any other TzHaar attack other races unprovoked and break our peace.",
    "That's terrible! No TzHaar-Ket would ever let any other TzHaar do such things and risk our peace. Even if it only steals. TzHaar would not be trusted anymore.",
    "Hm. It is far from good, but it is better than before. At least it does not kill JalYt unprovoked.",
    "Awful! No TzHaar-Ket would ever let any other TzHaar attack other races unprovoked and break our peace.",
    "At least peace with other races is not broken, but TzHaar-Ket should still catch criminal.",
    "I am not happy. Plot is horrible!",
    "Yes, TzHaar-Ket-Jok likes that.",

    "Good. And I want to defeat the TzHaar-Xil when it attacks me.",
    "Hm. Fine, I guess that is good enough. What else you want?",
    "TzHaar-Ket-Jok is happy with role.",
    "But completely unharmed!",

    "What do you want, [Title]-[Caste]-Player?",
    "Because it is stupid and not good! Fight Pit, that is good.",
    "Because different opponents' different skills to hunt down their prey makes it fun to watch. And it is made for TzHaar-Xil. Theatre is made for no one. Anything else you want to know?",
    "Stupid JalYt, you already made change! TokTz-Ket-Ek-Mack is TzHaar-Xil now. That is good.",
    "Yes, you had. Anything else?",
    "If there is a TzHaar-Hur and TzHaar-Mej in play, there should also be a TzHaar-Xil!",
    "Yes, that would be good. Shows that TzHaar-Xil are not to be underestimated and taken for granted.",

    "I can understand why TokTz-Ket-Ek-Mack would not tolerate JalYt like that. TzHaar-Xil-Mor would do the same! But it is still not really good.",
    "Too little TzHaar involved, but better than first story.",
    "Good with no JalYt and focus is on TzHaar, but a TzHaar-Xil would never be pushed around like that.",

    "What you want, [Title]-[Caste]-Player?",
    "TzHaar-Xil-Mor is not entirely pleased with TzHaar-Xil's plans always getting foiled. Makes TzHaar-Xil look stupid.",
    "That story makes TzHaar-Xil look like it does not know what it is doing! TzHaar-Xil's purpose is stealth and hunt and we are good at it.",
    "Stupid JalYt, you already made change!",

    "It does not matter! You have given out horrible roles and TzHaar-Xil-Mor refuses to be part of the play unless you change them.",
    "Good! You want anything else?",
    "At least you cannot make it worse. JalYt-Jenny is horrible.",
    "TzHaar-Xil-Mor would get killed!",

    "No, but TzHaar-Hur mine and other TzHaar are not distracted by it so it does not hurt if old TzHaar do it when they are too old to fulfil their caste duties. Was there anything else you wanted?",
    "If one TzHaar in play can be a TzHaar-Hur, then one should also be TzHaar-Mej.",
    "I have already told you, a TzHaar-Mej would never let TzHaar society go out of control like that.",

    "You do not know what you talk about, either of you! Now, was there anything else you wanted, JalYt?",
    "Not a good idea. TzHaar-Xil are kept very much in check by TzHaar-Mej. We have had years of experience how to keep them under control and they could not do anything like that without the TzHaar-Mej know about it.",

    "Horrible! Such an unbalanced society cannot possibly be the result of a TzHaar-Mej's organisation.",
    "That is horrible! A TzHaar-Mej would never allow such unbalance to happen in TzHaar society.",
    "That is not the truth! JalYt cannot be trusted with even this.",
