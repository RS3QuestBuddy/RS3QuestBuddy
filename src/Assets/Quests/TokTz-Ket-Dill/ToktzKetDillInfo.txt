If the examine info for a cave-in says "The damage in this location is bad / isn't too badly damaged", use a plank on it.`
If the examine info for a cave-in says "The damage in this location is very bad/badly damaged/very badly damaged", use a pillar on it. You cannot walk through these, and must place them from 1 tile away. Don't accidentally block yourself off with them, or you will need to push them over and get more pillars.`
If you run out of pillars, you can simply lobby and you'll end up outside of the cave, near the mine. You can then return to where you left off.`
Using the wrong item on a cave-in can cause a few hundred damage.`
