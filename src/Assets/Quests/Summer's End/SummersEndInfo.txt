Once you have 15, light 3 fire pits (5 each) by using logs on fire pits but do not light other fire pits during cutscene.`
(Optional) Restock your food and return to Summer to continue.`
Enter the next room by going through the passage in the south-east corner. (Chat 1)`
Avoid the missiles like before.`
Soon a dark core will appear, dig a hole in the soil and lure the core into it.`
Repeat this 3 times until you receive a cutscene. Note: If the beast eats your familiar, you will need another one or it will not launch the core.`
Enter the next room by going through the passage to the east. (Chat 1)`
