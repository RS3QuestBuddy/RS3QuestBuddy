    "Greetings again adventurer. How go your travels in Morytania? Is it as evil as I have heard?",
    "Well, that sounds like a good idea. Don't get into any trouble though!",
    "Well, not a great deal... but there is something you could do for me if you're interested. Though it is quite dangerous.",
    "Well, I understand, you must be busy.",
    "There's a man called Filliman who lives in Mort Myre, I wonder if you could look for him? The swamps of Mort Myre are dangerous though, they're infested with Ghasts!",
    "Filliman Tarlock is his full name and he's a Druid. He lives in Mort Myre much like a hermit, but there's many a traveller who he's helped. Most people that come this way tell stories of when they were lost and paths that just seemed to 'open up' before them! I think it was Filliman Tarlock helping out.",
    "Mort Myre is a decayed and dangerous swamp to the south. It was once a beautiful forest but has since become filled with vile emanations from within Morytania. The swamp decays everything. We put a fence around it to stop unwary travellers going in. Anyone who dies in the swamp is forever cursed to haunt it as a Ghast. Ghasts attack travellers, turning food to rotten filth.",
    "A Ghast is a poor soul who died in Mort Myre. They're undead of a special class, they're untouchable as far as I'm aware! Filliman knew how to tackle them, but I've not heard from him in a long time. Ghasts, when they attack, will devour any food you have. If you have no food, they'll draw their nourishment from you!",
    "That's great, but it is very dangerous. Are you sure you want to do this?",
    "That's great! Many thanks! Now then, please be aware of the Ghasts, you cannot attack them, only Filliman knew how to take them on. Just run from them if you can. If you start to get lost, try to make your way back to the temple.",
    "Please take this food to Filliman, he'll probably appreciate a bit of cooked food. He used to live to the South of the swamps, search for him won't you?",
    "I saved a few runes to allow me to travel quickly to Filliman's old camp, however I was never able to use them, and of course now I cannot leave. If you can return to me and confirm he is safe, I will gladly allow you to use them.",
    "That's fine, I'm sure someone else will be along shortly who can help. Now, if you will excuse me I do have some things to be getting along with.",
    "Have you managed to find Filliman yet?",
    "Please go and look for him, I would appreciate it!",
    "Search to the south of Mort Myre. Remember that he's a druid so he can conceal himself within nature quite well. My guess is that he lives in the southern area of the swamp, though he could be anywhere.",
    "A Ghast is a poor soul who died in Mort Myre. They're undead of a special class, they're untouchable apart from with special druidic items. Filliman knew how to tackle them, but I've not heard from him in a long time. Ghasts, when they attack, will devour any food you have. If you have no food, they'll draw their nourishment from you!",
    "Mort Myre was once a beautiful forest by the name of Humblethorn until the evil denizens of Morytania descended. Now their evil emanations have putrified and diseased the forest into a decaying swamp of death.",
    "Filliman is a druid of some considerable power. He helped many people in Morytania escape when the evil descended upon the land. His knowledge of plants and nature was exceptional. But one day, he was betrayed by some of the people who he had tried to help. This naturally made him more careful when dealing with strangers again and so, instead of showing himself, he would follow them. He would follow them at a distance and make the path clear for them, showing them to the temple and to salvation. Saradomin bless him! He is a good man.",
    "Many thanks to you [brother/sister]!",
    "Greetings again adventurer. How go your travels in Morytania? Is it as evil as I have heard?",
    "You mean... he's dead?",
    "Hmmm, that's very interesting, I seem to remember Father Aereck in Lumbridge and his predecessor Father Urhney having a similar issue. Though this is probably not related to your problem. I will pray that it wasn't the spirit of my friend Filliman, but some lost soul who needs some help. Please do let me know how you get on with it.",
    "Greetings again adventurer. How go your travels in Morytania? Is it as evil as I have heard?",
    "But you haven't sneezed!",
    "Very well my friend, prepare yourself for the blessings of Saradomin. Here we go!",
    "Ashustru, blessidium, adverturasi, fidum!",
    "There you go my friend, you're now blessed. It's funny, now I look at you, there seems to be something of the faith about you. It sounds like you should get back to Filliman without delay. Would you like me to use my runes to teleport you?",
    "Good luck, adventurer.",
    "I will keep them then, unless you manage to find our own way there.",
    "How's life been treating you since you got blessed?",
    "I still have the runes to teleport you to Filliman, if you require it?",
    "Greetings again adventurer. How go your travels in Morytania? Is it as evil as I have heard?",
    "Well, let me think now. Aha, yes, if you're making something from silver, you'll more than likely need a mould, most crafting shops sell them, you could get one from Al Kharid. You can mine silver from a silver rock, you can find some on the way to Al Kharid.",
    "Fantastic! You'd best take it to him with all haste. I was going to keep these runes in case I was able to leave; they're the last I have but I think you should use them. Would you like me to teleport you to Filliman again?",
    "I will keep them then, unless you manage to make your own way.",
    "That's great! How many did Filliman ask you kill?",
    "So, you've killed them all then! Go and tell him, I'll bet he'll be pleased.",
    "Greetings again adventurer. How go your travels in Morytania? Is it as evil as I have heard?",
    "That's fantastic, well done!"

    "Well, I'm going to look around a bit more.",

    "Who is this Filliman?",
    "Where's Mort Myre?",
    "What's a Ghast?",
    "Yes, I'll go and look for him.",
    "Yes, I'm sure.",

    "Sorry, I don't think I can help.",
    "Hello again!",
    "No not yet.",
    "Where should I look for Filliman Tarlock again?",
    "Explain to me what a Ghast is again.",
    "What's the story with Mort Myre?",
    "What's the story with Filliman Tarlock?",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "Hello there.",
    "Can I go through the gate please?",
    "But I'm doing a quest for Drezel!",
    "Huh? What's this?",
    "Huh! Now you're just not making any sense at all! I just cannot understand you!",
    "Hello?",
    "I'm wearing an amulet of ghost speak!",
    "Err.. Not exactly...",
    "Ermm, you don't understand... It's just that..",
    "Well, please don't be upset or anything... But you're the ghost!",
    "How long have you been a ghost?",
    "But it's true, you're a ghost... well, at least that is to say, you're sort of not alive anymore.",
    "What's it like being a ghost?",
    "But you are a ghost, look at yourself! I can see straight through you! You're as dead as this swamp! Err... No offence or anything...",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "Hello again!",
    "Yes, I do think you're dead and I'll prove it somehow.",
    "Here take a look at this, perhaps you can see that you're utterly transparent now!",
    "That's because you're dead! Dead as a door nail... Deader in fact... You bear a remarkable resemblance to wormbait! Err... No offence...",
    "Where did you put it?",
    "Here, I found this, maybe you can use it?",
    "Being dead, what options do you think you have? I'm not trying to be rude or anything, but it's not like you have many options is it? I mean, it's either up or down for you isn't it?",
    "So, what's your plan?",
    "Well, good luck with that.",
    "How can I help?",
    "I might be interested, what's involved?",
    "Well, that does seem a bit vague.",
    "Blessed, what does that do?",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "Hello again..[sic]",
    "No, not yet.",
    "Could I have another bloom scroll please?",
    "I've found Filliman and you should prepare for some sad news.",
    "Well, er sort of. I got to his camp and I encountered a spirit of some kind. I don't think it was a Ghast, it tried to communicate with me, but made no sense, it was all 'ooooh' this and 'oooh' that.",
    "Hello again! I'm helping Filliman, he plans to become a nature spirit. I have a spell to cast but first I need to be blessed. Can you bless me?",
    "You're so funny! But can you bless me?",
    "No so bad!",
    "Hello, I've been blessed but I don't know what to do now.",
    "Yeah, but what does that mean?",
    "Could I have another bloom scroll please?",
    "Yes, I have a fungus here that I picked.",
    "What are the things that are needed again?",
    "Ok, and 'something from nature' is the mushroom from the bloom spell you gave me?",
    "Do you have any ideas what those things are?",
    "What should we do when we have those things?",
    "Can we just place the components on any rock?",
    "I think I've solved the puzzle!",
    "Could I have another bloom scroll please?",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "I think I've solved the puzzle!",
    "A silver sickle? What's that?",
    "Where would I get a silver sickle?",
    "What will you do to the silver sickle?",
    "How can a blessed sickle help me to defeat the Ghasts?",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "No sorry, not yet!",
    "Hi again. Filliman has turned into the Nature Spirit. I now need to get a silver sickle so that I can try and defeat the Ghasts. Do you know where I could get something like that?",
    "Hi again. Filliman has turned into the Nature Spirit. I've just gotten the Silver sickle that he asked me to get. He says he's going to bless it!",
    "Yes, here it is. What are you going to do with it?",
    "Hiya, I'm a mighty Ghast killer! I've killed 3 so far!",
    "He asked me to kill 3!",
    "Not yet.",
    "How do I get to attack the Ghasts?",
    "What's this pouch for?",

    "Why you poor fellow, have you passed away and you want to send a message back to a loved one?",
    "You have come to haunt my dreams until I pass on your message to a dearly loved one. I understand. Pray, tell me who would you like me to pass a message on to?",
    "Yes!",
    "Don't be silly now! That in no way reflects the truth!",
    "What?! Don't be preposterous! I'm not a ghost! How could you say something like that?",
    "Don't be silly, I can see you. I can see that tree. If I were dead, I wouldn't be able to see anything. What you say just doesn't reflect the truth. You'll have to try harder to put one over on me!",
    "Oh, it's quite.... Oh... Trying to catch me out were you! Anyone can clearly see that I am not a ghost!",
    "No I won't take offence because I'm not dead and I'm afraid you'll have to come up with some pretty conclusive proof before I believe it. What a strange dream this is.",
    "Oh, hello there, do you still think I'm dead? It's hard to see how I could be dead when I'm still in the world. I can see everything quite clearly. And nothing of what you say reflects the truth.",
    "Well, that is the most peculiar thing I've ever experienced. This mirror must somehow be dysfunctional. Strange how well it reflects the stagnant swamp behind me, but there is nothing of my own visage apparent.",
    "I think you might be right my friend, though I still feel very much alive. It is strange how I still come to be here and yet I've not turned into a Ghast. It must be a sign... Yes a sign... I must try to find out what it means. Now, where did I put my journal?",
    "Well, if I knew that, I wouldn't still be looking for it. However, I do remember something about a knot? Perhaps I was meant to tie a knot or something?",
    "My journal! That should help to collect my thoughts.",
    "It's all coming back to me now. It looks like I came to a violent and bitter end but that's not important now. I just have to figure out what I am going to do now?",
    "Hmm, well you're a poetic one aren't you. Your material world logic stands you in good stead... If you're standing in the material world...",
    "In my former incarnation I was Filliman Tarlock, a great druid of some power. I spent many years in this place, which was once a forest and I would wish to protect it as a nature spirit.",
    "Won't you help me to become a nature spirit? I could really use your help!",
    "Will you help me to become a nature spirit? The directions for becoming one are a bit vague, I need three things but I know how to get one of them. Perhaps you can help collect the rest?",
    "Well, the book says, that I need, and I quote:- 'Something with faith', 'something from nature' and the 'spirit-to-become' freely given'. Hmm, I know how to get something from nature.",
    "Hmm, it does and I could understand if you didn't want to help. However, if you could perhaps at least get the item from nature, that would be a start. Perhaps we can figure out the rest as we go along.",
    "This spell needs to be cast in the swamp after you have been blessed. I'm afraid you'll need to go to the temple to the North and ask a member of the clergy to bless you.",
    "It is required if you're to cast this druid spell. Once you've cast the spell, you should find something from nature. Bring it back to me and then we'll try to figure out the other things we need.",
    "Oh, hello... Sorry, you've caught me at a bad time, it's just that I've had a sign you see and I need to find my journal.",
    "Thanks for the journal, I've been reading it. It looks like I came to a violent and bitter end but that's not really important. I just have to figure out what I am going to do now?",
    "Hello there, have you been blessed yet?",
    "Well, hurry up!",
    "Sure, but please look after this one.",
    "Ahhrs Oooohh arhhhhAHhhh.",
    "Yes, I know, I'm already dead! Thanks for reminding me.",
    "Well, you need to bring 'something from nature', 'something with faith' and 'something of the spirit-to- become freely given.'",
    "Hmm, it is a conundrum, however, if you use that spell I gave you, you should be able to get from nature. Once you have that, we may be puzzle the rest out.",
    "Sure, but please look after this one.",
    "Did you manage to get something from nature?",
    "Wonderful, the mushroom represents 'something from nature'. Now we need to work out what the other components of the spell are!",
    "Hello again! I don't suppose you've found out what the other components of the Nature spell are have you?",
    "The three things are: 'Something with faith', 'something from nature' and 'something of the spirit-to-become freely given'.",
    "Yes, that's correct, that seems right to me. The other things we need are 'something with faith' and 'something of the spirit-to-become freely given.",
    "I'm sorry my friend, but I do not.",
    "Ah yes, I looked this up. It says,.. 'to arrange upon three rocks around the spirit-to-become...'. Then I must cast a spell. As you can see, I've already placed the rocks. I must have planned to do this before I died!",
    "Well, the only thing the journal says is that 'something with faith stands south of the spirit-to-become', but I'm so confused now I don't really know what that means. Oh, if only I had all my faculties!",
    "Oh really.. Have you placed all the items on the stones? Ok, well, lets try! ~ The druid attempts to cast a spell. ~",
    "Hmm, something still doesn't seem right. I think we need something more before we can continue.",
    "Sure, but please look after this one.",
    "You've already got one! You don't need two!",
    "Aha, yes, that seems right well done!",
    "Oh really. Have you placed all the items on the stones? Ok... well, let's try! ~ The druid attempts to cast a spell. ~",
    "Aha, everything seems to be in place! You can come through now into the grotto for the final section of my transformation.",
    "Well, hello there again, I was just enjoying the grotto. Many thanks for your help, I couldn't have become a Spirit of nature without you. I must complete the transformation now. Just stand there and watch the show, apparently it's quite good!"

    "Yes, please."

  "Option 2": [
    "No, thank you."

  "Nature Spirit": [
    "Hmmm, good, the transformation is complete. Now, my friend, in return for your assistance, I will help you to kill the Ghasts. First bring to me a silver sickle so that I can bless it for you.",
    "The sickle is the symbol and weapon of the Druid, you need to construct one of silver so that I can bless it, with its powers you will be able to defeat the Ghasts of Mort Myre.",
    "You could make one yourself if you're artisan enough. I've heard of a distant sandy place where you can buy the mould that you require, it's similar in many respects to the creating of a holy symbol.",
    "Why, I will give it my blessings so that the very swamp in which you stand will blossom and bloom!",
    "My blessings will entice nature to bloom in Mort Myre! And then with nature's harvest you can fill a druids pouch and release the Ghasts from their torment.",
    "Have you brought me the silver sickle?",
    "Well, come to me when you have it.",
    "Have you brought me the silver sickle?",
    "My friend, I will bless it for you and you will then be able to accomplish great things. Now then, I must cast the enchantment. You can bless a new sickle by dipping it in the holy water of the grotto.",
    "Now you can go forth and make the swamp bloom. Collect nature's bounty to fill a druids pouch. So armed will the Ghasts be bound to you until, you flee or they are defeated. Before I can make this grotto into an Altar of Nature, I need to be sure that the Ghasts will be kept at bay. Go forth into Mort Myre and slay three Ghasts. You'll be releasing their souls from Mort Myre.",
    "You'll need this in order to collect together nature's bounty. When it contains items, it will bind the Ghast to you until you flee or it is defeated.",
    "Hello again, my friend. Have you defeated three ghasts as I asked you?",
    "Well, when you do, please come to me and I'll reward you!",
    "Go forth and with the sickle make the swamp bloom. Collect natures bounty to fill a druids pouch. So armed will the Ghasts be bound to you until, you flee or they are defeated.",
    "It is for collecting natures bounty, once it contains the blossomed items of the swamp, it will make the Ghasts appear and you can then attack them.",
    "You may use it wisely within the area of Mort Myre to affect natures balance and bring forth a bounty of natures harvest. Once collected into the druid pouch will the Ghast be apparent.",
    "If you should lose the blessed sickle, simply bring another to my altar of nature and refresh it in the grotto waters.",
    "Hello again, my friend. Have you defeated three ghasts as I asked you?",
    "Many thanks my friend, you have completed your quest! I can now change this place into a holy sanctuary! And forever will it now be an Altar of Nature!",
    "Welcome to my Altar to Nature! Farewell my friend, and keep those ghasts at bay!"
