Do the above step a total of three times.`

Enter the arcane doorway at the northern wall then the arcane doorway on the inner southern wall. (Chat 1•~)`
Kill Nomad.`
Strategies can be found here. Recommended if you haven't fought him before.`
If you are a high combat level (130+) and have tier 80 gear or higher, you will likely kill him easily without worrying about his final stun ability. Bring high-healing food like shark or sea turtle and just keep attacking him and healing while standing directly beside him.`
In short; bombs laid on the floor deal 4,000 damage when stepped on.`
Avoid them by walking DIRECTLY south, he does not place one there.`
"You cannot hide from my wrath" deals 7,500 damage. Either eat above that or hide behind a pillar.`
If he summons clones, the real one attacks you last, otherwise kill them all.`
An alternative is hide from them, after about 90 seconds the three fake ones will despawn. Make sure to re-attack him quickly after this so he does not reset, he does not use "Face me!" while clones are present.`
"Face me!" if he doesn't hit you in time, he restores his life points and teleports you. For example, if you were hiding behind a pillar.`
Towards the end of the fight he teleports you to the centre and stuns you. The next attack deals all your maximum life points, minus 1. So eat to full.`
If you bring a shield, swap to it and use resonance. This blocks the attack 100% but does not heal you.`
"This. Ends. Now" starts attacking you rapidly. It's important to finish him off at this point and not hide, otherwise he will restore his life points and you'll have to restart the fight.`
Finishing up`
