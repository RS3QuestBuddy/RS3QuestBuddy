    "You're a what?",
    "Ohhhhh, well, what's up, Ratty?",
    "Why, what seems to be the matter?",
    "That's awful! You're lucky to be alive!",
    "Maybe you weren't worth killing?",
    "The papers were the only valuable thing you had?",
    "So you don't sell anything worth having?",
    "You're not much of a trader are you?",
    "Shall I get them back for you?",
    "Oh dear. Well, I hope you get to Varrock okay!",
    "Sorry. I'm a bit busy right now.",
    "No thanks. I'm too busy right now.",
    "Fine!",
    "Good!!",
    "I'm going!",
    "I'm gone!",
    "No, sorry, I have to go!",
    "Uh, are you guilt tripping me?",
    "Well, good luck with that!",
    "No, that's not what...oh, never mind!",
    "Of course! Tell me what you need me to do.",
    "Don't worry, Ratty! I won't let you down!",
    "Hello there!",
    "I can't remember what I am supposed to do!",
    "Okay, thanks!",
    "I lost the folder you gave me. Do you have another one?",
    "My account? Am I in debt?",
    "Okay, thanks!",
    "Hello there!",
    "I got your pages back!",
    "Wait! Wait! Let me guess! You're actually a rich prince in disguise who wants to help poor people like me!?",
    "All work and no play makes Player a dull adventurer!",
    "Letter. Wizard. Varrock. Library. Got it!",
    "Hello there!",
    "What am I doing again?",
    "Oh yes! It's all flooding back now!",
    "I think I lost that letter you gave me!",
    "Will you take a cheque?",
    "I didn't come here to be insulted!",
    "No, look. I have a letter for you.",
    "Here it is!",
    "Why did you destroy the letter?",
    "Yes, there seems to be a lot of them going around at the moment.",
    "Okay, what do you need?",
    "How would I get something like that?",
    "How on earth do you know about Runecrafting? I thought only a few people knew of it.",
    "Where can I get a talisman or a tiara?",
    "Great! What is it?",
    "Is it a BIG secret?",
    "Bigger than a house?",
    "Bigger than a volcano??",
    "No thanks. I have other things to do for now!",
    "Uh, why are you repeating yourself like that?",
    "Oh.",
    "Remind me what I am doing again?",
    "I lost the wand!",
    "How much gold will I get?",
    "Really? Powerful, eh? How powerful?",
    "Depends on what?",
    "Can I ask about the diary?",
    "Who is this Sin'keth?",
    "The Dagon-what?",
    "Hey, wait! Isn't your last name Magis too? Are you related to him?",
    "Where did it come from?",
    "Oooo, tetchy!",
    "Where is the safe route?",
    "No, really! It's okay! You can tell me where it is!",
    "Can I have another one?",
    "Yes, I seem to have misplaced the last one.",
    "Never mind, I forgot the question.",
    "Where is that tome you mentioned, again?",
    "Hello there!",
    "That's right! I did your leg work. Now, how about a reward?",
    "Indeed!",
    "Thanks very much!",
    "Thanks, but I already have one.",
    "Uh, thanks.",
    "What tunnel?",
    "Oh, I see. Well, what can you tell me about it?",
    "That's extremely handy!",
    "Why not?",
    "Sorry, who are you?",
    "Pleased to meet you.",
    "Who does this statue represent?",
    "Consider me awed!",
    "What are you doing here?",
    "That's extremely handy!",
    "Why not?",
    "Maybe. I might do.",
    "Okay, I'd better go.",
    "Aren't you going to go inside?",
    "Okay, then. I'm going in to have a look!",
    "I can't tell you. It's a secret!",
    "I made the wand that you asked me for, but I seem to have lost it!",
    "I have the things you wanted!",
    "So...about this gold that you're going to give me?",
    "Okay, but I'll be back for my gold.",
    "This letter is treasonous! I'm going to report you to the king!",
    "Who are you really?",
    "So what's in it for me?",
    "Not that I'm complaining about the living part, but I was expecting something of more...er...value?",
    "Fine. I will deliver the letter, but I will be back soon.",
    "Do I still get the gold?",
    "Fine. I will deliver the letter, but I will be back soon.",
    "I'll never join you!",
    "Fine. I will deliver the letter, but I will be back soon.",
    "And there had better be lots of gold!",
    "That letter was treasonous so I destroyed it!",
    "Yes!",
    "Ah...uh...yes...yes, I do.",
    "Your majesty, I think that you should see this letter.",
    "This letter was delivered to me by hand, your majesty. I think you may be in some danger.",
    "I don't think you understand...",
    "I'm trying to save your life!",
    "I'm just saying that the letter is real.",
    "Because I'm supposed to deliv...oh.",
    "I...er...I reckon it's a fake! ...I guess...",
    "Hello there!",
    "Yes! I have a letter for you.",
    "Yes, and you have some explaining to do!",
    "This letter from Surok to you implies that you're involved in a treasonous plot! I should tell the guards about you!",
    "What, you're still here?",
    "You have? Who told you that?",
    "Okay. Go on.",
    "Okay, I had a feeling you weren't a real trader due to the fact that you had nothing to sell! So why the secrecy?",
    "I think I can believe that. Surok's not the nicest person in Misthalin!",
    "Uh oh! I think I may have helped him by mistake, here. He promised me a big reward if I collected some items for him...but he said it was for a spell to make gold!",
    "Thank you! How can I help fix this mistake?",
    "Okay, who is it?",
    "Yes, sir! I'm on my way!",
    "Hello there!",
    "What am I doing now?",
    "Okay, I better go!",
    "Do you think we can stop Surok?",
    "You know, your cart IS kind of small!",
    "Oh, nothing! It's very...er...cute!",
    "Do you have anything to trade yet?",
    "Ah yes, I remember!",
    "Hey, your cart has no donkey!",
    "Oh. I used to know a guy called Rick Shaw!",
    "I've been told of your foul plans, Surok! You lied to me about the gold, so I've come to stop you!",
    "I'll fight you if I have to!",
    "Rat Burgiss sent me!",
    "Okay, so what's the plan?",
    "Why must I summon you? Can't you come with me?",
    "Okay, so what do I do now?",
    "Won't he be disinclined to acquiesce to that request?",
    "Won't he refuse?",
    "Okay, thanks, Zaff!",
    "Of course! Thanks again!",
    "I need to ask you something else.",
    "What am I doing again?",
    "Okay, thanks!",
    "Can I have another ring?",
    "Can I have the instructions again?",
    "Sorry, I was just testing the ring.",
    "Sorry, I was just testing the ring.",
    "Hello there!",
    "I have been to see Zaff and he has told me to go and arrest Surok.",
    "So what happens now?",
    "Oooh! Do we have adventurer's insurance?",
    "Oh, well that sounds just as good!",
    "What are my orders again?",
    "Right then.",
    "Okay, I need to go!",
    "Can you tell me of the Dagon'hai?",
    "Surok gave me a diary that spoke of them. Do you know anything about them?",
    "What do you mean?",
    "So where are they now?",
    "So how do you know about them?",
    "Oh, I see.",
    "At ease, soldier!",
    "Uh, yes, sorry! I forgot about that!",
    "What benefits do I get in the VPSG?",
    "So I don't get the secret spy-pack then?",
    "I've lost that ring I had!",
    "Surok!! Your plans have been uncovered! You are hereby under arrest on the authority of the Varrock Palace Secret Guard!",
    "Give yourself up, Surok!",
    "The place is surrounded. There is nowhere to run!",
    "Bring it on!",
    "Fine! You win this time!",
    "Uh oh! King Roald looks evil!",
    "Uh oh! King Roald looks evil!",
    "Why did you teleport us? We were winning!",
    "So what do I do now?",
    "Surok!! Your plans have been uncovered! You are hereby under arrest on the authority of the Varrock Palace Secret Guard! The place is surrounded. There is nowhere to run!",
    "Bring it on!",
    "Wait! Let me keep fighting!",
    "Yes. Let this be a lesson to you.",
    "We did it! We beat Surok!",
    "It was all in the call of duty! What will happen with Surok now?",
    "Okay, I will.",
    "Of course. I understand. Goodbye!",
    "Hello there!",
    "You should have been there! There was this...and Surok was like...and I was...and then the King...and, and...uh...ahem! The mission was accomplished and the king has been saved.",
    "You know, one thing bothers me. He's now stuck in the library, but wasn't that the reason we were in this mess in the first place?",
    "Hello there!",
    "So, do you have any more jobs for me to do?",
    "Any time, Rat!",
    "Can I have another ring?"
  ],
  "Rat Burgiss": [
    "Oh, hello. I'm Rat.",
    "No, no. My name is Rat. Rat Burgiss.",
    "It's Rat, thank you. And I, uh...heh...I seem to be in a bit of trouble here, as you can probably see.",
    "Well, I'm a trader by nature and I was on the way to Varrock with my cart here when I was set upon by outlaws! They ransacked my cart and stole some very important papers that I must get back.",
    "Yes, I know! I don't know how I survived.",
    "...",
    "Look, do you want to help me or not?",
    "Uh...yes. I guess so.",
    "Ah! Uhh...no, not really.",
    "No...I mean yes... Look, that's besides the point. Can you help me?",
    "You mean you want to help?",
    "Uh...so you can't help me?",
    "Don't you want another quest?",
    "Well, fine!",
    "Good!",
    "So go then!",
    "Go then!",
    "Oh well. I'll just wait here then and maybe some nice person will help me. Perhaps...one day...",
    "No! Not at all! Nuh-uh! Nope! Hardly! Noooo, no no no! Well, maybe a bit...",
    "Thanks!",
    "Right, now I heard those outlaws say something about having a small campsite somewhere to the west of the Grand Exchange. They headed off to the north-west of here, taking five pages with them.",
    "Kill the outlaws and get those papers back from them for me. Here's a folder in which you can put the pages. Be careful, though; those outlaws are tough. When you find all 5 pages, put them in the folder and bring them back to me!",
    "...",
    "Hello again! How are things going?",
    "Head north-west from here into the forest west of the Grand Exchange. Find the camp of outlaws and kill them. Collect the pages of my document for me and put them into the folder I gave you. When the folder contains five pages, bring it to me!",
    "Sure. Here you go. I'll add it to your account.",
    "No, it's just the way you're standing!",
    "Ah, hello again.",
    "Excellent! I knew you could help! Let me take those from you, there.",
    "Now, I liked the way you handled yourself on that last little 'mission' I gave you there, so I'm going to let you in on a little secret!",
    "Uhhh...no. No, that's not it. You know, on second thought, I think I'll keep my secret for now. Look, instead, you can do another job for me.",
    "Yes, well, I'm sure that may be the case. However, what I want you to do is take this letter to someone for me. It's in a different language so, trust me, you won't be able to read it. Take it to a wizard named Surok Magis who resides in the Varrock Palace Library. I'll see about some sort of reward for your work when I get myself sorted out here.",
    "Yes, good luck then.",
    "Ah, hello. How is your task going?",
    "Take that letter I gave you to Surok Magis, the wizard found in the Varrock Palace Library.",
    "I see. Well, try not to drown yourself with all that brain usage!",
    "Goodness me! Not much of a messenger, are you? Here's another one; try not to lose it this time! I've charged the parchment to your account.",
    "No thanks. I prefer tartan.",
    "Ah, Player! Good to see you! I heard you got my letter to Surok. Well done!",
    "Yes, of course! I'd be happy to give you a reward, but I have a lot on my mind with...you know...trader...stuff!",
    "You're going to poke someone's eye out, waving that around like that!",
    "What on earth is that?",
    "I see! It looks pretty magical; I'd be careful with that if I were you!",
    "Ah, Player! You've returned!",
    "A letter for me? Let me see.",
    "Why? Whatever do you mean?",
    "I'm sure I don't know what you mean. Let me see the letter, please.",
    "Yes. I still haven't found someone to help me yet, but I hear you've been very busy yourself!",
    "Oh, I have my sources. Was there anything else?",
    "This letter is treasonous! This does indeed confirm my worst fears. It is time I let you into my secret and hopefully this will answer any questions you may have.",
    "I am not really a trader. I am the Commander of the Varrock Palace Secret Guard. VPSG for short.",
    "I'm just getting to that. A short while ago, we received word that Surok had discovered a powerful mind-control spell and intended to use it on King Roald himself! He could control the whole kingdom that way!",
    "Yes, but until now, the spell has been useless to him as he is currently under guard at the palace and not allowed to leave. He could not get the tools for the spell because if he left the palace he would be arrested!",
    "Yes, we heard that somehow Surok had obtained the things he needed but we were not sure how. I thought it might have been you. However, I assumed you did not know of his plans; that is why you weren't arrested!",
    "Okay, here's what I need you to do. One of my contacts has devised a spell that he is sure will be able to counteract the effects of the mind-control spell. I need you to visit him.",
    "His name is Zaff. He runs a staff shop in Varrock. Go and speak to him and he will tell you what you should do. I will send word to him to let him know that you are coming.",
    "Yes, Player?",
    "You need to go and see Zaff. He can be found at 'Zaffs[sic] Staffs', the staff shop in Varrock. He will tell you what to do next.",
    "Okay, good luck!",
    "Surok is a powerful mage and ruthless too. Who knows what will happen. I am sure that we will prevail, though. Don't worry, Player! You'll be fine!",
    "What are you implying?",
    "Why exactly are you still here?",
    "No, I'm afraid I have nothing in stock, largely due to the fact that I'm not really a trader, as I just mentioned.",
    "Yes, that would be because it's a rickshaw cart.",
    "You don't say...!",
    "Ooh! Shiny! I would take it, but I'd probably have to sell it. I have a wife and 17 children to feed! Besides, you probably need it more than me right now!",
    "Ah, hello. How is your task going?",
    "Excellent! In that case, we are all set and ready to foil Surok's plans!",
    "Now it is all down to you, Player. As you have proven yourself in the tasks I have set you, I am making you an honorary member of the VPSG!",
    "Well...no. But we do have a nice lady called Emma who makes the tea on Mondays.",
    "Right then. You have an important task set out for you. Good luck, Player!",
    "You will need to go and speak to Surok now. Arrest him under the authority of the Varrock Palace Secret Guard.",
    "It may be tough and Surok will most likely not be arrested without a fight, so be on your guard!",
    "Yes, you have an important job! Good luck, Player!",
    "How do you know of them?",
    "I see. The Dagon'hai were a powerful order of Zamorakian mages who resided here in this very city. However, the priests of Saradomin warred ferociously with them and tried to destroy them. The Dagon'hai, though, were very clever and extremely cunning.",
    "They hid themselves away within the city and, rumour has it, they even had a way of getting to the Wilderness and back without ever being seen, although I have no idea how that might have been.",
    "Nobody knows. They disappeared from the city a hundred years ago and very few people even remember who they were.",
    "My grandfather's brother, my great uncle, was a priest of Saradomin and he would tell me stories of the wars with the Dagon'hai as a child.",
    "You shouldn't mock your commanding officer, private! Don't forget, I can still have you arrested for conspiracy with Surok!",
    "Unfortunately, as an honorary member of the VPSG, you only get to act under our authority. You aren't entitled to the full Secret Guard package.",
    "I'm afraid not. No.",
    "Then you will have to go and speak to Zaff at Zaff's Staffs to get another one!",
    "Well, Player, how did it go?",
    "I take it that it went alright, then? That's great news! Zaff has already briefed me on the events. We will arrange for Surok to be fed and watched. I think he will not be a problem any more.",
    "Yes, you are right. But rest assured, we will be watching him much more closely from now on. You've done very well and have been a credit to the VPSG; perhaps one day there may be a place for you here! In the meantime, let me reward you for what you've done. I will be sure to call on you if we ever need help in the future.",
    "Ah! Player! You did a fine service for us. You might make a good member of the VPSG one day, with a little training and a bit more muscle!",
    "At the moment, no. Things seem pretty quiet. However, I have heard a rumour about something strange going on in...hmm, no, I think we can handle this one for now. But, who knows? We may need your assistance again soon. Thank you, Player."

  "Surok Magis": [
    "Hah! Come for my Aphro-Dizzy-Yak spell! Want someone to fall madly in love with you, eh? Not surprised with a face like that, to be honest!",
    "Really? Well, with ears like that, you do surprise me!",
    "Really? Well then, let me see it!",
    "Of all the luck!",
    "None of your business! It's a secret!",
    "Of course. Hmmm. However, I could let you in on another secret, if you like?",
    "My secret is this. I have been spending time here in the palace library trying to discover some ancient spells and magics. In my research, I have uncovered a most astounding spell that will allow me to transform simple clay into solid gold bars! Now I am ready to use the spell to create all the gold I...uh...the city wants. I would gladly share this gold with you; I simply need a few more things!",
    "I will only need a couple of items. The first is very simple: an ordinary bowl to use as a casting vessel. You should be able to find one of these at any local store here in Varrock. I would go myself but I am...uh...busy with my research. The other item is much harder. I need a metal wand infused with chaos magic.",
    "Take this metal wand. You will also need 15 chaos runes. When you get to the Chaos Altar, use the wand on the altar itself. This should infuse the runes into the wand.",
    "Hah! Don't presume to think that those wizards in their fancy tower are the only people to have heard of Runecrafting! Now pay attention! You will need to have the 15 chaos runes in your inventory. Make sure you also have either a chaos talisman or chaos tiara to complete the infusion.",
    "I'm afraid I don't know. You will need to search for one. Bring the infused wand and a bowl back to me and I will make us both rich! One more thing. I have uncovered information here in the library which may be of use to you. It tells of a safe route to the Chaos Altar that avoids the Wilderness.",
    "It is an old tome...a history book of sorts. It's somewhere here in the library. I forget where I left it, but it should be easy enough for you to find. I have also given you a copy of a diary I...uh...acquired. It may also help you to find that which you seek.",
    "It's a very big secret!",
    "Er, yes! It's...",
    "Yes. Look, it's big, alright? Now listen and I'll tell you.",
    "Very well, then. I hope these other matters of 'great' importance outweigh the need to make a LOT of gold. A WHOLE lot of gold. Gold. Yes, gold.",
    "Dramatic effect.",
    "Ah! You're back. Have you found the things I need yet?",
    "Somehow, I knew that would happen so I have made a few spares for just such an occasion!",
    "Here you are. Try not to lose this one!",
    "Here you g...hang on! There's one still in your inventory! I just saw it! You don't need two and they're not worth anything...yet! Now get going already; there's not much time!",
    "You would lie to an arch-wizard? There is one in your bank! I can sense it! Go and retrieve that one first!",
    "Hmmmm. That all depends on how quickly you get me that infused wand! Work fast and well for me, Player, and I will make you rich, famous and powerful!",
    "That depends.",
    "On how soon you stop yapping and get me that wand! Now get moving!",
    "Of course. What would you like to know?",
    "Sin'keth Magis? From what I have read, it would appear he was a great leader of the Dagon'hai Mages.",
    "Hmph! If you read the diary or perused that tome I mentioned, you would know who they are.",
    "No. Not at all. Purely coincidence! Now, haven't you got work to do already?",
    "How I came to have the diary is of no concern to you!",
    "I suggest that you concentrate on getting the things I need and stop asking pointless questions!",
    "I could tell you, of course; I know more or less exactly where it is. However, that would take all the fun out of this, wouldn't it?",
    "No, I think you should see if you can find it for yourself. I have given you the diary and, along with the tome around here, you should be able to find that alternate route easily enough on your own!",
    "You want another copy of the diary?",
    "Fine, but this diary is important you know! It has secrets that you should not share around with just anybody!",
    "Hang on! I can see the last copy I gave you in your inventory there! You don't need another one!",
    "Fair enough. Go then. I expect you have a lot of work to do!",
    "Like I said, it's lying around here in the library somewhere. It should be easy enough to find.",
    "Yes, I just gave that to you. Don't break it already!",
    "No thanks, I don't need that.",
    "You lost it? Those wands are extremely powerful and dangerous in the wrong hands! You better hope someone doesn't find it! Hmph! In the meantime, here's another metal wand. Go and make another infused wand for me... and be more careful this time! My Patience is growing thin!",
    "You say you made the infused wand for me? Then why do you still have that metal wand I gave you? Go and do what I ask before I lose my temper and turn you into a worm or something!",
    "Well?",
    "No, it looks like you still need to find me a bowl first. An ordinary bowl. You can get one from one of the stores around here.",
    "Excellent! Well done! I knew that you would not let me down.",
    "All in good time. I must prepare the spell first, and that will take a little time. While I am doing that, please take this letter to Rat, the trader outside the city who sent you here.",
    "Yes, yes, yes. Now off you go!",
    "Hah! And what would make him believe you? They would think it was a fake! Besides, if you still want the gold I promised, you would do well to deliver that letter for me. Join me and together we can rule Misthalin!",
    "That is not your concern! I am Surok Magis and I am more powerful than you can possibly imagine!",
    "You get to live. For now.",
    "Ah, yes. The gold. Don't you worry, I am still working on that. Just deliver my letter for me, first. Now be off!",
    "I am sure you will.",
    "If that is your only concern, then yes, you do. But I must warn you, my patience with you is wearing thin. So go now and do my bidding!",
    "I am sure you will.",
    "My, my! How heroic! Not that it matters. I don't need you for my plans. However, if you want this gold, then you would do well to do as you are told.",
    "I am sure you will.",

    "Really? You destroyed it?",
    "You want another one, don't you?",
    "Fine. Here you are. And stop all this complaining; it's getting me down!",
    "Oh really? And what makes you think you have even the slightest chance of doing that?",
    "Enough! You have been of use to me before but now you are wasting my time! Be gone!",
    "So! You're with the Secret Guard, eh? I should have known! I knew you had ugly ears from the start...and your nose is too short!",
    "Never! I am Surok Magis, descendant of the High Elder Sin'keth Magis, rightful heir of the Dagon'hai Order! I will have my revenge on those who destroyed my people!",

    "Okay, then. The tunnel awaits...",
    "Why, the Chaos Tunnel of course! I imagine Surok will have told you of it.",
    "Well, story and rumour has it that the Dagon'hai built a tunnel here under the statue of Saradomin that would allow them to visit the Chaos Altar without having to go through the Wilderness.",
    "Yes, it is. Or, at least, it would be. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get in there so far.",
    "The tunnel entrance needs to be cleared before anyone can get in there. However, my Mining skill isn't high enough at all to do it myself. Perhaps you could have a go?",
    "My name is Louisiana Jones, although most people call me Anna. I'm an archaeologist.",
    "Likewise!",
    "That, my dear, is the statue of the great god Saradomin himself. Stand and admire in awe for you are in the presence of greatness!",
    "Indeed!",
    "Well story and rumour has it that the Dagon'hai built a tunnel under this statue of Saradomin that would allow them to visit the Chaos Altar without having to go through the Wilderness.",
    "Yes, it is. Or, at least, it would be. I came to excavate the tunnel but, unfortunately, there so far.",
    "The tunnel entrance needs to be cleared before anyone can get in there. However, my Mining skill just isn't what it used to be. Perhaps you could have a go?",
    "Okay, then!",
    "You opened the tunnel; well done!",
    "I'd better not. My orders were to open up the entrance and wait for Surok to arrive. When he gets here, we'll go in together. He promised me a lot of gold for this job!"

    "Letter? Let me see. Where's Postie Pete? He usually deals with the mail around here.",
    "Hmmm. I see. I appreciate your concern. However, I assure you, I am quite safe here. My guards are on full alert at all times.",
    "I understand perfectly. Now, for all I know, that letter could be a fake ruse. We get a lot of that sort of thing and it causes a lot of hassle.",
    "And you are shouting at your king! People who yell at their monarchs often find their heads become...loose!",
    "Then why do you have it?",
    "It seems to me that if that letter were genuine, I would be forced to arrest its bearer for treason. You understand. So what do you say?",
    "Just as I thought! Now off you go!",
    "What's going on...?",
    "I...must...kill...Player!!",
    "Have at you!",
    "Take that, knave!",

    "Would you like to buy or sell some staves or is there something else you need?",
    "Ah, yes; You must be Player! Rat sent word that you would be coming. Everything is prepared. I have created a spell that will remove the mind control from the king.",
    "Listen carefully. For the spell to succeed, the king must be made very weak. If his mind is controlled, you will need to fight him until he is all but dead. Then and ONLY then, use your ring to summon me. I will teleport to you and cast the spell that will cure the king.",
    "I cannot. I must look after my shop here and I have lots to do. Rest assured, I will come when you summon me.",
    "Take this beacon ring and some instructions. Once you have read the instructions, it will be time for you to arrest Surok.",
    "Won't he what?",
    "I very much expect so. It may turn nasty, so be on your guard. I hope we can stop him before he can cast his spell! Make sure you have that ring I gave you.",
    "Rat has told me that you are to be made an honorary member of the VPSG so that you can arrest Surok. If you have any questions about this, ask Rat. One last thing: you must remember that as part of the VPSG, we must remain secretive at all times. For this reason, I cannot discuss matters such as this unless absolutely necessary!",
    "Would you like to buy or sell some staves or is there something else you need?",
    "Go ahead!",
    "Make sure you have read the instructions I gave you about the ring. Then, when you are ready, go to Surok and arrest him!",
    "You have one already. It's there in your inventory!",
    "Remember, I am a member of the VPSG and we see everything! My sources tell me there is one in your bank. Go back and retrieve it from there!",
    "Well, I do happen to have another one here that you can have. Please try and be a bit more careful with this one!",
    "You have one already. It's there in your inventory!",
    "Remember, I am a member of the VPSG and we see everything! My sources tell me there is one in your bank. Go back and retrieve it from there!",
    "Well, I do happen to have another one here that you can have. Please try and be a bit more careful with this one!",
    "What are you doing, Player? I'm right here! Why are you trying to summon me again?",
    "Well, stop playing around; I'm a busy man!",
    "Okay, Surok, your time is ov...hey! What gives? You don't need me yet! Why did you use the ring?",
    "Look, stop messing around! My shop doesn't look after itself, you know! Hmm. Perhaps I could invent a spell that would do that...",
    "Would you like to buy or sell some staves or is there something else you need?",
    "The king was not weak enough and Surok's power over him was still too strong! You must weaken the king further before summoning me. Otherwise, we will fail.",
    "I am afraid we must try again. We will defeat Surok this time. I am sure of it!",
    "The king's still too strong! We had better get out of here!",
    "It's too late! I cast the spell as soon as you summoned me, but it was too early! We need to withdraw and plan our attack again!",
    "Sin danna nim borha!!",
    "The king's mind has been restored to him and he has been teleported away to safety. Now, to deal with Surok!",
    "You will not escape justice this time, Surok!",
    "Stop!",
    "Your teleport spell has been corrupted, Surok! I have placed a magic block on this room. You will remain here, under guard, in the library from now on.",
    "Thank you for your help, Player. I will put the room back in order and then I must leave. Surok is defeated and will be no more trouble for us. We will guard him more closely from now on!",
    "Would you like to buy or sell some staves or is there something else you need?",
    "Yes. You have done well, Player. You are to be commended for your actions!",
    "Well, when I disrupted Surok's spell, he will have been sealed in the library, but we will still need to keep an eye on him, just in case. When you are ready, report back to Rat and he will reward you.",
    "Sadly, however, after this I will not be able to discuss these matters with you again. They are secret and we must be vigilant. The VPSG will prevail!",
    "Would you like to buy or sell some staves or is there something else you need?",
    "There's still one in your inventory, Player!",
    "Go and get the one that's in your bank, Player!",
    "Yes, of course, Player. Here you are. Please bear in mind that this ring has no charges left with which to summon me, however."
