Head north and clear more enemies than Marmaros by clearing out the rooms as fast as possible, you are required to have at least 4 more kills than Marmaros at the end of the dungeon for unabridged tome.

Attack and kill the Gluttonous behemoth`
Note: there is a common glitch, where the behemoth is stuck on 1HP and you cannot finish it off. To fix this, you can relog by quitting the RS client and logging back in. You will spawn outside, but you can continue from last checkpoint, which is right before the bossfight.`
It will heal from, and subsequently kill, the Grave Creeper and Hobgoblin Geomancer.`
Head west and watch the cutscene.`
Saga complete!
