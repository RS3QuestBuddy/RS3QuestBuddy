  "Captain Rovin": [
    "What are you doing up here? Only the palace guards are allowed up here.",
    "Well go and do it somewhere else!",
    "Hmmm, an explorer, eh? I might have a little task for you if you're interested.",
    "Yes, 'quest' would be an apt description, if that appeals more to you adventurer types.",
    "I'd use my own guards for this but, for some reason, I have a high staff turnover and I don't have the men to spare. Anyway, I've recently been receiving reports of zombies organising in the Wilderness.",
    "The concept of zombies in the Wilderness I'm not worried about, but one of my scouts has reported large numbers of them forming ranks. Zombies don't naturally organise themselves, so someone must be organising them. There",
    "are necromancers in the Wilderness who've caused problems with zombie armies in the past. I need you to find out what's going on and whether or not it's a threat to the security of Varrock.",
    "The scout who reported the zombies will be able to tell you that. HARTWIN, GET UP HERE!",
    "Hartwin, tell us about the zombies you witnessed in the Wilderness.",
    "Yes, yes, the Graveyard of Shadows, I know of it. Get to the point please.",
    "Right, well, [player] is more experienced in combat than you. I want the two of you to go up there and investigate further, to find out who this 'shadowy figure' is and what they're planning.",
    "If you're so busy, stop wasting time up here. This room is still off-limits, you know.",
    "Are you ready to get going on your mission to the Wilderness yet?",
    "Well, I hope you're ready soon. We've not got all day.",
    "Are you ready to get going on your mission to the Wilderness yet?",
    "HARTWIN, GET UP HERE. (S)HE'S READY TO GO!",
    "Haven't you two made it to the Graveyard of Shadows yet?",
    "So, what news[sic] from your scouting mission?",
    "What information have you found out about this army?",
    "I need to know what the zombie army is up to! Get down that trapdoor and figure out what is going on.",
    "Hartwin turned up here. He says that you had to leave and do something else. Are you ready to continue the mission?",
    "HARTWIN, GET UP HERE. (S)HE'S READY TO GO!",
    "Well, I hope you're ready soon. We've not got all day.",
    "So, what news[sic] from your scouting mission?",
    "Zemouregal! Are you sure? That's bad news. For as long as the people of Varrock can remember, Zemouregal has been talked about in hushed tones as one to be feared. Zemouregal attacking Varrock again is people's",
    "greatest fear and worst nightmare. You must head back into the Wilderness and find out what Zemouregal is planning.",
    "So, what news[sic] from your scouting mission?",
    "Zemouregal! Are you sure? That's bad news. For as long as the people of Varrock can remember, Zemouregal has been talked about in hushed tones as one to be feared. Zemouregal attacking Varrock again is people's",
    "greatest fear and worst nightmare.",
    "Wow, this is quite some news you bring, and not of the happy sort. I'm almost afraid to ask, but any news on Zemouregal's plans?",
    "It's almost too frightening to contemplate that the fall of Varrock could come to pass in our lifetime. What can we do to stop this?",
    "The Shield of Arrav? Hmm, yes, but is it really any use? The legends say the son of the founder held the shield and the zombies fell before him, but, in recent years, we have not been able to unlock such power. We had thought that",
    "maybe the legends were exaggerated and it was just an ordinary shield.",
    "Then, [player], I entrust you to speak to this Thurgo and seek his advice on how to use the shield to defend our city. In the meantime, I shall move the shield into the palace - it will be better defended here than in the",
    "museum.",
    "Have you spoken to that dwarf yet?",
    "Have you spoken to that dwarf yet?",
    "So, what are you doing back here?",
    "We haven't got time for that. See if you can find that forge.",
    "There are zombies all over the palace! I hope you bear good news or we're all doomed. It can't be long until they move on the rest of Varrock.",
    "I'm not sure myself. There are various census records and the like in the Palace Library downstairs. I'd start by looking there.",
    "I brought the shield up here for its protection; here, you'd better take it with you.",
    "Any progress on finding the descendant of the founder of Varrock? These zombies are ripping the place apart.",
    "Please try to make some progress; I quite like Varrock.",
    "Here, I have the Shield of Arrav; you'd better take it with you.",
    "Wow, you did it! The zombies have all gone and you've saved Varrock! The beacon network you helped to test also saved a lot of lives.",
    "Well, thanks to you both. This victory will go down in Varrock history.",
    "Yes, I doubt it's the last we've heard of them; hopefully, it will be a long, long time before they can rebuilt their forces and cause us much harm."

  "Player": [
    "Just exploring, really.",
    "Ooh, good, sounds like a quest.",
    "What sort of task are we talking about here?",
    "Zombies in the Wilderness? That doesn't seem all that unusual to me.",
    "Where in the Wilderness have these zombies been spotted?",
    "I've got other things I'd rather be doing.",
    "Okay, let's get going.",
    "No, I need to do some things first.",
    "No, I'm not ready yet.",
    "Yes, I'm ready now.",
    "Okay, let's get going.",
    "No. We are on our way, though.",
    "Well, here we are in the graveyard. There's a few zombies here, but it's hardly an army.",
    "Brilliant, Hartwin. Let's follow these and see where they go.",
    "We've tracked the zombie army to a hidden trapdoor.",
    "Err, nothing yet.",
    "Yes, I'm ready now.",
    "Okay, let's get going.",
    "No, I'm not ready yet.",
    "Shh, they'll hear us.",
    "Well, we managed to track down the zombie army. What's more, we discovered that they're being commanded by a mahjarrat going by the name of Zemouregal.",
    "Arrav, could it be that you're fighting Zemouregal's control?",
    "I'm sorry. That sounds like it must be awful.",
    "Hartwin, let Arrav speak.",
    "Is there anything we can do?",
    "Well, we managed to track down the zombie army. What's more, we discovered that they're being commanded by a mahjarrat going by the name of Zemouregal.",
    "Yes, he plans for Arrav to lead the zombie army in an attack on Varrock, and he plans it soon.",
    "At least one exists. In my travels I've met an imcando called Thurgo, living in southern Asgarnia.",
    "No, not yet. I'll be on my way shortly.",
    "I'd like to ask about the Shield of Arrav. I've heard that the imcando dwarves know about this item.",
    "I know that - I've just come from there. There are, however, legends that say it can be powerful, if used correctly. I need to know how to unlock that power to defend Varrock from a deadly foe.",
    "What? What? Tell me.",
    "What on RuneScape is Camdozaal?",
    "Have you not looked for it yourself?",
    "So, any more information on how to find Camdozaal?",
    "I've lost that piece of paper that shows the location of Camdozaal.",
    "Yes, he didn't know a lot. Not to worry, though: he gave me another lead. I may be able to discover what we need if I can find a lost imcando 'Sacred Forge'.",
    "Err, I thought I'd report back on my progress.",
    "Redberry pie?",
    "Okay, here you go.",
    "No, it's my pie.",
    "Wow! I didn't expect to find anyone down here.",
    "Wow, how did you survive here so long?",
    "Why are you wearing that cloth?",
    "So, this is Camdozaal?",
    "Wow, another imcando dwarf!",
    "Well, I have to admit that race hasn't fared well. I know one who is named Thurgo. I don't know if there are any others about. You're considered a rather endangered species.",
    "I wish to use the Sacred Forge.",
    "The city of Varrock is under grave threat from Zemouregal the mahjarrat. We have an artefact called the Shield of Arrav, which we think may be able to help, but we don't know how to unlock its power.",
    "Thank you, Ramarno.",
    "Well, I've done a fair bit of Smithing.",
    "I've now put the blurite in the forge.",
    "Traiborn! What are you doing here?",
    "I never knew my mind was so weird.",
    "That was scary. I must get back to Varrock as quickly as possible.",
    "Thank you for your help with the forge. I must get back to Captain Rovin as quickly as possible.",
    "Don't panic, I'm working on it.",
    "That's all, thanks.",
    "They're an army belonging to Zemouregal.",
    "I'm sorry, Your Majesty. I'm trying to get rid of them.",
    "It's an invasion by Zemouregal.",
    "I am working on a plan to get rid of them, fingers crossed.",
    "It's an army of zombies belonging to Zemouregal the mahjarrat.",
    "I am working on a plan to get rid of them, fingers crossed.",
    "What are you doing here?",
    "Don't panic, I'm working on how to deal with them.",
    "Not really. Normally, they stick to caves and sewers.",
    "Don't you think you should try and get to somewhere safer?",
    "Hi Arrav, it's me, [player].",
    "Is Zemouregal not letting you speak?",
    "I guess that's a no.",
    "Arrav, snap out of it.",
    "That didn't work.",
    "Talk to me, Arrav!",
    "Don't ignore your mate, Arrav!",
    "Well, that normally gets people's attention, but it doesn't seem to be doing a lot here.",
    "Sort of. I know that only someone of a certain bloodline can use the shield: a descendant of one of the first elders of Varrock. I'm not sure how I'd find someone of that lineage still alive today, though.",
    "Not yet, no.",
    "Reldo, I need your help. I must find out if there are any living descendants of the founder of Varrock.",
    "Reldo, this information may help us to defeat the zombies. Now, I know that the founder of Varrock became an elder of the town during the same time of the legendary Arrav. That's as much as I know.",
    "Well, I'm sure I'll find it. Once I've found the names, I still need to find who is descended from them.",
    "Thanks, Reldo, you've been very helpful.",
    "The list of elders looks useful, but I still need to find someone who is descended from the elders.",
    "Hmm. The Varrock Census - year 160. That means it's nine years out of date.",
    "Actually, no, I don't have it. How embarassing. I'll be back in a bit.",
    "So I can see. We might have a solution with this shield, though.",
    "I have a reason to believe that you are descended from an original elder of Varrock.",
    "No, Your Majesty, but it might mean that you can use the shield to defeat the zombies. Here, hold the shield and see if anything happens.",
    "It must be someone else who is descended from the correct elder, then. Ah, well, thank you for your time.",
    "I need your help with this shield.",
    "It's the Shield of Arrav. A descendant of an original elder of Varrock can apparently use it to stop the zombie army. You're one of those descendants, although I'm not sure if you're the right one.",
    "It must be someone else who is descended from the correct elder then. Ah, well, Prysin, thank you for your time.",
    "Well, your surname is Prysin. It matches the name of an early elder called Khom Prysin.",
    "So, are there any genuine Prysins about?",
    "Well, that's handy to know. Thank you for your help.",
    "They're an army belonging to Zemouregal.",
    "You might be able to help with this shield, though.",
    "I have reason to believe you are descended from an original elder of Varrock, which might mean that you have the ability to use the shield to defeat the zombies. Here, hold the shield and see if anything happens.",
    "It must be someone else who is descended from the correct elder then. Ah, well, Aeonisig, thank you for your time.",
    "Well, your surname is Raispher. It matches the name of an early elder called Dathero Raispher.",
    "So, are there any genuine Raisphers around?",
    "Well that's handy to know. Thank you for your help.",
    "Hi. I need to speak to you. A zombie army invaded the palace and you might be the one who is able to stop them.",
    "Ah, but the Shield of Arrav may be able to help here.",
    "I have reason to believe that you are descended from an original elder of Varrock, which might mean you have the ability to use the shield to defeat the zombies. Here, hold the shield and see if anything happens.",
    "It must be someone else who is descended from the correct elder then. Ah, well, thank you for your time.",
    "Well, your surname is Halen. It matches the name of an early elder called Marv Halen.",
    "So, are there any genuine Halens around?",
    "Well that's handy to know. Thank you for your help.",
    "Horvik, I need to speak to you about a matter of some urgency. A zombie army invaded the palace and you might be the one who is able to stop them.",
    "I'm sure it would be - but I have here the Shield of Arrav!",
    "I have reason to believe that you are descended from an original elder of Varrock, which might mean you have the ability to use the shield to defeat the zombies. Here, hold the shield and see if anything happens.",
    "It must be someone else who is descended from the correct elder then. Ah, well, thank you for your time.",
    "No, thanks. I'm just looking around.",
    "Well, your surname is Ravitz. It matches the name of an early elder called Ramone Ravitz.",
    "So, are there any genuine Ravitz's around?",
    "Well that's handy to know. Thank you for your help.",
    "Dimintheis, I need to speak with you about a matter of some urgency. Zombies have invaded the palace and you might be the only one able to stop them.",
    "I'm hoping the Shield of Arrav may help a little.",
    "I have reason to believe that you're descended from one of the original elders of Varrock, which might mean you have the ability to use the shield to defeat the zombies. Here, hold the shield, see if anything happens.",
    "It's never done anything like that before! I think you might be the one - a descendant of the founder of Varrock.",
    "Quick, let's go to the palace and see what the shield does to zombies.",
    "Dimintheis Fitzharmon helped as well.",
    "It's a pity that we didn't catch any of the leaders. Zemouregal, Sharathteerk and Arrav are all still at large."
