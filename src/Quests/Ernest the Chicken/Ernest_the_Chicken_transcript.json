    "Can you please help me? I'm in a terrible spot of trouble. My fianc\u00e9, Ernest, and I came upon this house. Seeing as we were a little lost, Ernest decided to go in and ask for directions. That was an hour ago...and that house looks spooky. Can you go and see if you can find him for me?",
    "Thank you, thank you. I'm very grateful. I think I spotted some lights flashing in one of the top floor windows, so you may want to head up there first.",
    "Oh. I'm so worried. I hope someone will help me soon.",
    "Have you found my sweetheart yet?",
    "Have you found my sweetheart yet?",
    "I know he\u2019s not exactly brave, but I think you\u2019re being a bit harsh.",
    "Eeeeeek! My poor darling! Why must these things happen to us?",
    "Well, be quick. I\u2019m sure being a chicken can\u2019t be good for him."

    "No, not yet.",
    "Yes, he's a chicken.",

    "There's a sign on the door that says:",
    "So you know where he is?",
    "Ernest is a chicken? Are you sure?",
    "Ernest's fianc\u00e9e. She probably doesn't want to marry a chicken.",
    "I think you'd better change him back.",
    "Well, I can look for them.",
    "Any clues?",
    "I'm afraid I don't have any of them yet.",

    "Ah, Ernest - top notch bloke - he's helping me with my experiments.",
    "He's that chicken over there.",
    "Oh, he isn't normally a chicken, or, at least, he wasn't until he helped me test my pouletmorph machine. It was originally going to be called a transmutation machine, but after testing it, pouletmorph seems more appropriate.",
    "Who's Veronica?",
    "Oh, I dunno. She could have free eggs for breakfast every morning.",
    "Umm... It's not so easy... My machine is broken, and this house has long been pestered by poltergeists. They seem to reap joy from hiding my belongings and, in this case, the vital parts to my machine.",
    "That would be a huge help. They'll be somewhere in the manor house or its grounds outside. I'm missing the pressure gauge and a rubber tube. They've also taken my oil can, which I'm going to need to get this thing started again.",
    "Well, I wouldn't be surprised if you found something in my IQ-testing room under the manor where I test my...creations. Oh, and if I were you, I'd stay away from the coffin in the basement. Even the poltergeists daren't go near it.",
    "Nothing at the moment...it's broken. It's meant to be a transmutation machine. It has also spent time as a time travel machine, a dramatic lightning generator, and a thing for generating monsters.",
    "No, I'm just one of the tenants. It belongs to the count who lives in the basement.",
    "Have you found anything yet?",
    "I need a rubber tube, a pressure gauge and a can of oil. Then your friend can stop being a chicken.",

    "Cluck!",
    "Thank you, [sir/m'lady]. It was dreadfully irritating being a chicken. How can *cluck* I ever thank you?",
    "Of course, of course. You may as well have these eggs and *cluck* feathers I mysteriously *bwark* found in my pockets."
