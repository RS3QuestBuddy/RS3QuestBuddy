    "Thank you, Aster.",
    "Apparently they'll let just anyone in these days. I should have a word with Siv about it.",
    "Sorry Siv, I don't have time for this right now.",
    "I agree. A duke was murdered right here, on our watch!",
    "And dark beasts got in and attacked the queen!",
    "And an assassin attacked me. Me!",
    "What we really need are some guards.",
    "Oh?",
    "Do you know the Raptor?",
    "I'll go and deal with him. You try to find us some guards.",
    "Any luck with those guards, Siv?",
    "I'm working on it.",
    "Can I help you?",
    "That's right! I built it myself. The King has charged me with defending Misthalin against the Zamorakian threat.",
    "In return, he made me a-",
    "It *is* the Wilderness, you know.",
    "That doesn't sound ideal.",
    "We?",
    "Alright, what do we do?",
    "Got it.",
    "How goes guard recruitment, Siv?",
    "I'm afraid we have a minor situation outside the walls. I'll let you know when it's resolved.",
    "I have no business using this right now.",
    "I don't think I should be going down there right now.",
    "Undead cleared! I should see what our new friend has to say about the attack.",
    "He's not the friendliest, but he helped me deal with a little problem I had.",
    "I'm currently working to fortify the walls, which should help keep out prevent[sic] any uninvited guests.",
    "One thing at a time, Siv.",
    "Looks like that's the undead threat averted.",
    "I feel like walls are probably enough to dissuade a few zombies.",
    "I hadn't considered the risk of zombie gymnastics. I'll speak to Bill and see if we can get something in place.",
    "Hello, Bill.",
    "Of course, Bill, go ahead.",
    "Yes.",
    "Oh?",
    "That sounds great, Bill, but right now I need to add some additional defences to the walls in case more zombies attack.",
    "That could work. I assume I have to source the logs myself as usual?",
    "You do? We could have used those to build the fort!",
    "It's not safe out there, Bill. I'll handle the assembly, you get back inside as soon as you can.",
    "I'm on top of it, don't worry, all the supplies are in place.",
    "That's all of them! I should see if Siv has had any luck with recruitment.",
    "I've built the fortifications.",
    "I was pretty excited too.",
    "Well... I'm going to check with Siv to see how she's getting on with those guards. Try not to scare anyone.",
    "The Raptor and I squashed a few zombies outside, and I've fortified the outer walls.",
    "Don't worry, we handled it.",
    "Oh? That's good news, but how are we going to pay for them?",
    "Sounds like everything is well in hand then. Will we house them here in the command centre?",
    "Where, then?",
    "Of course! I'll have Bill draw up some plans for a guardhouse immediately.",
    "Not yet, Siv. I still need to speak to Bill.",
    "I just thought you should know we have guards on the way now.",
    "I'm going to have my architect draw up some plans for a guardhouse.",
    "Good talk.",
    "I'll have to stop you there, Bill. We need to repurpose your plans.",
    "A tavern sounds lovely, but what we need much more urgently is a guardhouse.",
    "Exactly.",
    "Great work as always, Bill. Sorry about your inn.",
    "Bill's drawn up plans; I'm working on them at the moment.",
    "Bill drafted a really good plan for a beer garden.",
    "We repurposed it into a guardhouse.",
    "Well, I'll just get on and build it by myself then.",

    "Moving on...",

    "Yes?",

    "Are they...",

    "Siv, a moment please?",

    "Welcome to Fort Forinthry!",
    "Try not to steal anything.",
    "So I hear. Tell me more about them.",
    "Still?",
    "Are there a lot of bandit gangs in the Wilderness?",
    "What happened to the Dark Warriors then?",
    "Why?",
    "I hear you.",

    "What are you doing here?",
    "Could you be raising an undead army to attack my fort?",
    "Your minions are easily defeated!",
    "Run from a fight? That doesn't sound like you.",
    "That was intense! Hopefully the Raptor can tell me what we're up against.",
    "Yes, we did. It seems a necromancer named Zemouregal was summoning them as a distraction.",
    "I'm not sure yet. Hopefully the Raptor can tell me what we're up against.",
    "What? Why?",
    "You don't seem like the kind to care about something like that.",
    "I'm sure we can find somewhere for you to sleep. A new vacancy has just opened up, in fact.",
    "We have some rather undisciplined guards in need of guidance.",
    "Yes, yes. I expect all they really need is a good example.",
    "Excellent leadership skills!",
    "You'll have to address me as 'your grace', of course!",
    "Of course. We won't let the fort come to harm.",
