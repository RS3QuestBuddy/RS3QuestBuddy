    "Arr, treasure you be after eh? Well I might be able to tell you where to find some... For a price...",
    "Well for example if you can get me a bottle of rum... Not just any rum mind... I'd like some rum made on Karamja Island. There's no rum like Karamja Rum!",
    "Gadzooks, that swill! Not a chance! It's Karamja Rum or no deal.",
    "Fair enough. I'll still be here and thirsty whenever you feel like helpin' out.",
    "Yer a saint, although it'll take a miracle to get it off Karamja.",
    "The Customs office has been clampin' down on the export of spirits. You seem like a resourceful young lad, I'm sure ye'll be able to find a way to slip the stuff past them.",
    "Arr, that's the spirit!",
    "Arr!",
    "Nothin' at the moment, but then again the Customs Agents are on the warpath right now.",
    "Arr, Matey! Have ye brought some rum for yer ol' mate Frank?",
    "Not surprising, 'tis no easy task to get it off Karamja.",
    "The Customs Office has been clampin' down on the export of spirits. You seem like a resourceful young lad, I'm sure ye'll be able to find a way to slip the stuff past them.",
    "Was there anything else?",
    "Arr, Matey! Have ye brought some rum from yer ol' mate Frank?",
    "Now a deal's a deal, I'll tell ye about the treasure. I used to serve under a pirate captain called One-Eyed Hector. Hector were very successful and became very rich. But about a year ago we were boarded by the Customs and Excise Agents. Hector were killed along with many of the crew, I were one of the few to escape and I escaped with this.",
    "This be Hector's key. I believe it opens his chest on his old room in the Blue Moon Inn in Varrock. With any luck his treasure will be in there.",
    "I'm not allowed in the Blue Moon Inn. Apparently I'm a drunken trouble maker.",
    "No lad, you got it fair and square. You enjoy it. It's what Hector would have wanted."

    "No, the crate isn't full yet...",

    "Yes, are you going to pay me yet?",
    "No, it's a complete mess.",
    "Yes, I've got some.",

    "Well I know her pretty well. She doesn't cause me any trouble any more. She doesn't even search my export crates any more. She knows they only contain bananas.",
    "There is a little shop over in Port Sarim that buys them up by the crate. I believe it is run by a man called Wydin.",
    "Have you completed your task yet?",
    "There's a crate ready to be loaded onto the ship. If you could fill it up with bananas, I'll pay you 30 gold.",
    "Well come back when it is.",
    "I sell them to Wydin who runs a grocery store in Port Sarim.",
    "Well done, here's your payment",
    "Yes certainly. If you go outside you should see the old crate has been loaded on to the ship, and there is another empty crate in its place."

    "Well, I get all of mine over at the clothing shop in Varrock. They sell them cheap there. Oh, and I'm sure that I've seen a spare one over in Gerrant's fish store somewhere. It's the little place just north of here.",
    "Wow - you are well prepared! You're hired. Go through to the back and tidy up for me, please.",
    "Is it nice and tidy round the back now?",
    "No, I'm the one who works here.",
