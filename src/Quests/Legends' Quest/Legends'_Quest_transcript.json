You also need to befriend a native from the Kharazi tribe in order to get a gift or token of friendship. We want to display it in the Legends Guild Main hall. Are you interested in this quest?",

    "Excellent! Ok, you'll need this starting map of the Kharazi Jungle.",
    "Complete this map when you get to the Kharazi Jungle. It's towards the southern most part of Karamja. You'll need additional papyrus and charcoal to complete the map. There are three different sectors of the Kharazi Jungle to map.",
    "It is likely to be very tough going. You'll need a hatchet and machete to cut through the dense Kharazi Jungle. Collect a machete from the cupboard before you leave. You'll need to find your own hatchet, preferably a good one. Finally, we really do need some sort of display item for the Guild hall. Bring back some sort of token which we can display in the Guild.

Bring back a tribal gift from the natives so that we can display it in the Legends Guild. I hope that answers your question!",

I guess I just wouldn't want to do it myself. But a map of that area would certainly be a big task. And it would certainly be very useful...-- The forester looks very thoughtful --Hey, if you manage to complete it, be sure to let me take a look! Well, best of luck with it, I'm sure you're going to need it.",

    "Well, it had the desired effect... I am Gujuo, proud member of the Kharazi tribe. What did you want to talk about Bwana?",
    "Very good Bwana... this is indeed a very pleasant gesture. However, my people are very distributed throughout the Kharazi Jungle.",
    "All of my people normally congregate around a totem pole. But ours has been polluted by an evil spirit. It has been transformed, and now our people are afraid to approach it. We tried to drive the evil spirit out of the totem pole, but it does not seem to work.",
    "We could try to make a new totem pole. However, we need to make it from the trunk of the sacred Yommi tree.",
    "First we need to plant a sacred Yommi tree. It is a magical tree of great power, however, our Shaman 'Ungadulu' is the only person with the seeds for this tree.",
    "And I fear that it is impossible to get some seeds. He is being held against his will in some caves in the north western part of the Kharazi Jungle.",
    "You make me very happy Bwana! In the north western part of the Kharazi Jungle area, near some great cliffs, you will find three rocks that form a roughly triangular shape. They are flanked by the palm which also forms the divine geometry. The stones are the entrance, search them well. That's where you'll find Ungadulu. If you can free him he will entrust you with some sacred Yommi tree seeds. I have work to do Bwana. I may see you again.",
    "Yes Bwana, perhaps we will become friends sometime in the future... But not today... Ungadulu has problably lost his mind anyway...  It is most likely a lost cause...",
    "You are more than welcome bwana...",
    "The mosquitos bite me, bwana! I must go for a swim.",
    "We would be very grateful and would be pleased to develop friendly relations with you. Do this thing for us all, my people would be very happy.",

    "Yes Bwana. I can take you to the edge of the Kharazi Jungle. Would you like me to take you?",
    "Follow me...",
    "As you wish... Again, Bwana, What is it that brings you to the Kharazi Jungle?",
    "How goes your quest to release Ungadulu Bwana?",
    "Well, they were still there the last time I checked... Go as far to the west in the Kharazi Jungle as you can, until you reach the sea, then walk eastwards with the barrier rocks to the north. Walk past the covered pass and you'll find some rocks on slightly elevated ground. You'll find the caves there.",
    "You are more than welcome bwana... I have to collect herbs now, Bwana.",
    "How goes your quest to release Ungadulu Bwana?",
    "Be wary Bwana. There are many unknown spirits that reside in these dark areas. You may be tricked by an unknown force...",
    "Strange spirits that our forefathers summoned for visions. They haunt the underworld and caves that exist in this area. Take not anything as it might first appear.",
    "I am unlearned in such matters. But I am told of sacred patterns that are scored on the ground to bind the spirit and confine it... But that is all I know.",
    "I am at a loss as well Bwana. At this time Ungadulu is the only one who might know of a solution for this puzzle and at this time, he is part of that same puzzle.",
    "Farewell Bwana, good luck.",
    "That's fine Bwana, not to worry. I hope your quest is going well in any case.",
    "This sounds very strange Bwana... but maybe I can help. There is a pool of water that is sacred to us. It is located in the middle of the Kharazi Jungle. The water contains special properties but it can only be contained in a blessed vessel made from metal of the sun. The water is difficult to get to, but I am sure you will manage to claim some.",
    "It is a bright and precious metal that is much sought after, though uncommonly found. It is the same glorious colour as the sun and it never loses its wondrous lustre. A blessed vessel made of this metal protects the purity of the water.",
    "It is found in some rocks and must be extracted. It has a magical ability over some people, it possesses them. They fall within its power and seek to gain more and more of this precious metal for themselves. A blessed vessel made of this metal protects the purity of the water.",
    "A vessel made of sun metal, but it can be of any shape. However, it must be blessed.",
    "Here, have this as an example... I pray that it will help you.",
    "When you have made the vessel, bring it to me. I will help but you need to ensure that you are devout and have faith. Your ability in prayer will be thoroughly tested.",
    "It seems that Ungadulu has started to lose his senses. In our native and ancient history, the 'Vacu' were the servants of the evil spirits from the underworld. The 'Vacu' were priests who summoned the spirits of our ancestors. But the priests were enslaved by the evil spirits of the underworld. It is but a myth, perhaps a story told to scare badly behaved children.",
    "You are more than welcome bwana...",
    "I have to collect herbs now, Bwana.",
    "Greetings Bwana. Ah I see you have the golden bowl! Would you like me to show you how to bless it?",

    "Ohhhhhmmmmmm.",
    "Ohhhhhmmmmmm.",
    "Ohhhhhmmmmmm.",
    "How goes your quest to release Ungadulu?",
    "You are indeed brave Bwana, a truly fearsome warrior to take on such an enemy! Well Done!",
    "That's great Bwana. Now you just need to germinate the seeds and then plant them in some fertile soil. I'm sure that Ungadulu has explained all this to you already.",
    "If you have the Yommi tree seeds, you will need to germinate them. You need to place the seeds into pure water, and they will begin to sprout tiny shoots. You can then plant them in fertile soil.",
    "Congratulations on releasing Ungadulu! My people are very pleased... How goes the growing of the Yommi tree?",
    "Well done Bwana. With the blessings of the gods we will soon have our Totem Pole. Bwana, you now need to plant the seed in the fertile earth.",
    "You should be able to find many places where the ground is fertile in the Kharazi Jungle. Planting the Yommi tree seeds in fertile soil gives it a good chance to grow. My people are trying to grow the Yommi tree as well. But so far we have not met with any success. If you find a rotten tree or what looks like a rotten totem pole, You'll need to remove it yourself to get to the fertile soil. It will take a very sharp, robust hatchet to do it.",
    "I have visited Ungadulu in the caves, he is hard at work studying. He looks well! Have you grown the Yommi tree yet?",
    "This is indeed a bad omen Bwana, that pool is sacred to us. I have seen it and it is full of filth, it is not natural. I suspect that some evil is at work here.",
    "Well, it requires pure sacred water for it to grow. It is a very special tree...",
    "Yes, it is a magical tree and can only survive on the water from the sacred pool. This is indeed a tragedy.",
    "I am not sure but I have heard that deeper in the catacombs where you found Ungadulu, deep underground there is a terrible place guarded by the undead.",
    "Since they died trying to find the source of the stream, they are cursed to guard it for all eternity. The first to seek the source was said to be a high level sorcerer.",
    "He created a powerful spell in the caves. Now, all those who venture near are overcome by a supernatural fear. With all my heart Bwana, I would never go near such a place.",
    "I understand Bwana, it would be a waste of a perfectly good life. We will try to defeat the evil spirits in other ways. But I am not sure how we will do that.",
    "I have visited Ungadulu in the caves, he is hard at work studying. He looks well! How is your quest going Bwana?",
    "If the pool of sacred water has dried up, there may be a way to get to the source of the spring. But it is said to be very, very dangerous.",
    "Perhaps the location has been hidden or buried under rubble? These stories were told to me as a child by the village elders. They were probably meant to frighten us away from the caves. It could all just be a myth! You should perhaps talk to Ungadulu, he may know something? Perhaps there is another way to get to the source of the stream? But I am not sure where it is...",
    "Well, if you are sure you want to go, I will assist as much as I can. You will need the bravery of the jungle lion, if you are to go into that forbidden place. I can give you the recipe for a potion to help with that.",
    "You will need to find two herbs, snake weed and ardrigal. Add them both to a vial of water, and you will walk with the bravery of the Kharazi lion.",
    "Snake weed is usually found by swampy marshy areas. It is not very common and it may be quite difficult to find. There is some marsh to the south of Tai Bwo Wannai village. The herb grows near around very carefully.",
    "Ardrigal is often found growing near to large groups of palms. Such a collection exists in the north. If you head east out of Tai Bwo Wannai village you should come across them. The herb grows in the shade of the palm so check carefully.",
    "I would urge you to take it, Bwana, I have heard that the caves are protected by a supernatural fear that renders even the bravest man to a trembling wreck. You will need all your wits about you when dealing with the terrors that exist down there.",
    "I have visited Ungadulu in the caves, he is hard at work studying. He looks well! How is your quest going Bwana?",
    "That's great Bwana, good luck with your quest and take care!",
    "Well, I have heard that name before, perhaps from the eldars.",
    "Ah, yes, I think that is the name of the wizard who first went in search of the source. Be wary of him Bwana, he may try to trick you.",
    "Hello Bwana, I'm very pleased to see you again. Things seem much happier now in the Kharazi Jungle. I suspect that it is down to your good doings!",
    "Great Bwana, you are truly a brave warrior. Now you can try to grow the Yommi tree in earnest and make the totem pole.",
    "You are indeed very brave Bwana, we have noticed a difference in the Kharazi Jungle, the trees seem to sing again. And we have you to thank for it.",
    "You will need to grow the Yommi tree to full height. And then, before it rots, you must chop it down. Once you have felled the tree, you need to trim the branches. And finally, you need to craft the totem pole out of the trunk. You'll need a very sharp, very tough hatchet to do all this. But once you have completed the totem pole, You will need to use it to replace a totem pole that already exists, as they're all placed on sacred areas to my people.",
    "Hello Bwana, I'm very pleased to see you again. Things seem much happier now in the Kharazi Jungle. I suspect that it is down to your good doings!",
    "Well Bwana, it's a very interesting piece of work, not bad at all. Now we need to replace an existing corrupted totem pole with your newly constructed one. You should find those totems within the Kharazi Jungle.",
    "Greetings Bwana, we saw your fight with the Demon from some distance away. My people are so pleased with your heroic efforts. Your strength and ability as a warrior are Legendary.",
    "Please accept this as a token of our appreciation.",
    "Please, now consider yourself a friend of my people. And visit us anytime.",
    "I'll take those germinated Yommi tree seeds to Ungadulu, I'm sure he'll appreciate them.",
    "I am tired Bwana, I must go and rest.",
    "Good day Bwana. The Kharazi Jungle is especially beautiful today isn't it? My village people pass on their thanks to you.",
    "Just that everything is fine in the jungle with us. And that we are grateful to you for your help.",
    "My people are all happy living in the jungle. They are still afraid of strangers and will not approach but they are around, none the less. Your story has been woven into the fabric of our society. And we all sing your many praises Bwana.",
    "Well, that wasn't very nice of you. It took us a long time to make that Totem pole. Luckily, I made another one at the same time."

    "You already have some Yommi tree seeds, use those first... and let me know how you get along.",
    "Oh, yes, Bwana... you will be doing a great favour to our people by doing this. However, you must know that it is a difficult task, the Yommi tree is difficult to grow. You must have a natural ability with such things to have a chance...",
    "Here you are, accept these with my gratitude. You'll need to soak them in sacred water before planting them. I notice that you must already be familiar with sacred water to have passed into the flaming octagram.",
    "A good question Bwana, but it is essentially quite simple. First you will need to soak the seeds in some pure water. This will help to germinate the seed and begin the growing process. The Yommi tree is sacred and is also slightly magical. You need to seek out a patch of fertile earth. Such places are located around the jungle and should give the Yommi tree a good chance of survival. The tree should show some remarkable growth quite early but will slow down, you may be able to speed the process up by watering the tree with more pure water, although it can be difficult to find it.",
    "Hmmm, the pure water is sacred to us. It is from a sacred spring which is fed from deep underground. Legend has it that the spring is protected by spirits of long dead adventurers who went in search of the source of the spring. It is likely a myth and the source of the spring is buried deep underground with no paths to it.",
    "Now that you have defeated the demon you can come and go as you please. I cast a spell on you which means that you can pass through the flames without harm.",
    "I will remain here in the protection of the flaming Octagram and continue my research into the spirit world. I am somewhat of an authority with my recent experience! But do remember me from time to time and come to visit an old man. You never know, I may be able to the future, and repay you the favour from that terrible Demon...",
    "My sincerest pleasure Bwana...",
    "Hello Bwana, how goes your quest to find the water?",
    "You did well to come to me Bwana. As I said before, I am an expert in spirits of the underworld. In most circumstances you should just ignore them. However, beware as many spirits will try to trick you.",
    "That sounds very strange Bwana, I'm glad to see you didn't commit such a foul act. I can make a spell that would help you to defeat the spirit. But I need an item that belongs to the spirit to make it work. If you have something like that, please show it to me and I'll give you the spell. Beware of everything in these caves, I was tricked very easily and was enslaved, as you well know. Learn from my example.",
    "I know something about them, especially magical daggers. If you have a specific one, show it to me and I'll help as much as I can.",
    "This dagger has been made for one purpose only...  Praise the gods that you brought it to me. I can make you a spell with this item which will force the spirit to reveal its true self. Once activated, you will be able to attack it like a normal creature. I can make you a spell with this item which will force the spirit to reveal its true self. Once activated, you will be able to attack it like any normal creature.",
    "Use this spell on the Spirit. It will force the spirit to show its true self. And it will also be vulnerable to normal attacks."

My spirit burns with the need for revenge, I shall not rest while I sense his spirit still. If you seek the pure water, you must ensure he meets his end. If not, you will never see the source and your journey back must ye start. What is your answer? Will ye put an end to Viyeldi for me?",

But tragedy of tragedies, his spirit is neither living or dead. He serves the needs of the source. He died trying to collect the water from this stream, and now I hang in torment for eternity.",
    "Yes, you may get some water, but first you must help me. Revenge is the only thing that keeps my spirit in this place. Help me take vengeance on Viyeldi and I will gladly remove the rocks and allow you access to the water. What say you?",
