    "Primrose wouldn't talk to me. She wouldn't look at me. I'd find scraps of her meals tucked into her pillowcase. She was dying, so much faster than before. And she was pulling at the last threads of life, hoping to find Death at the other end. I'd lost her. I went to Gail. What else could I do? I begged for another wish. To take the 30 days, to go back again. Gail calmed me and told me to return tomorrow. The Needle would be recharged, and I could return to Primrose's birthday. I could do this all again.",

    "It got serious once Primrose got ill. She would keep their counsel, rather than talk to me.",
    "She did it when I wasn't watching, but I knew. She would write poems with them, sing with them, confide in them, ask them for their thoughts.",

    "Doctors, visitors, they all make that mistake. Judge her by the disease, the microscopic evil magnified into something huge.",
    "But I see the strength. Damn girl always lets an argument go un-won. She'll fight for the things she loves, for sure.",
    "And she's full of love. Not always for her mum, but you know, it's there. Growing up, she loved everything, cared for everything.",

    "But I arrived at the house. There was the bang-bang of the door, slamming in the wind.",
    "I abandoned the cart, rushed in. I called for Primrose. Nothing.",

    "Gail led me to the hilltop. Her hands were so cold and hard. I felt numb, but I couldn't figure out if it was from me or her.",
    "She showed me something called the Needle. Gail asked again, did I really want my wish? She had to shake me to get an answer.",

    "But Primrose would be alive.",
    "I agreed, and Gail pulled thread from the Needle. She separated the thread into strands, and a dome of fabric fell about us.",
    "The dome flashed with blinding light. You couldn't see about you, it was impossible. As the light faded, Gail gestured me to my house and said 'Be with her'.",
    "I rushed through the door and checked the calendar. 30 days back - my daughter's birthday. I checked my bedroom. There wasn't another Megan in there.",
    "Then I went to Primrose. She was asleep in her bed. I sat in the chair, watching her. No one was going to budge me from that spot. Not ever.",

    "I prepared to use the pausing phrase: 'Wenla'",
    "Perhaps, somehow, we will be found. With the Needle, they will understand our story and save us all. Megan, Primrose and myself.",
    "It's the only way this can all be unwritten.",
    "I was born as I am now. I didn't have a mother, father or childhood. I was me, nothing more, and I came to... next to the Needle.",
    "I knew what The Needle was, but I knew next to nothing about myself. It's a back-to-front way of learning about the world.",
    "I knew how to use The Needle, what its limits were, how it used time. But I had no idea about people, the world, nothing.",
    "I'm learning fast and leaving a trail of mistakes behind me, I am sure of it.",

    "Joss, Primrose and Megan weren't the first people I had encountered.",
    "There were the people of the Colony to the east. But they were a fearful people, and hid behind their walls.",
    "There were the smaller people of the south-east. They were quick to their pikes, and pushed me back into the treeline.",
    "Men and women would occasionally stray close to me, but they were so caught up in their hunting and woodcutting that I didn't want to interrupt.",
    "But there was something different about the family. They seemed to have this happy energy, and I wondered what it would be like to share in that.",

    "I struggled with what 'family' meant. Never having parents or siblings will do that to you.",
    "But I've found myself pulled into Primrose and Megan's lives more and more, like a black hole.",
    "I've tried to move on and away, but they've needed me. I've felt responsible. I've wanted to see them happy. And - if I'm honest - I've felt happy that they needed me.",
    "I can only imagine that is what 'family' means.",

    "Megan asked that I stay by the Needle. She was to look after Primrose from now on. Somewhere along the line, she had lost her trust in me.",
    "Before a Returning, she would often burn Primrose's books.",
    "It was like a ritual. A habit that she couldn't crawl out of. But Primrose wouldn't wake from it this time. She lay in bed and ignored it.",
    "If Megan was clearer of mind, she would have seen it for the clue that it was: Primrose was aware of everything she was doing.",

    "Ever since Megan burned the books, something had moved in her. It was like Megan shifted aside, to be seen only occasionally.",

    "But no. There was someone in there with her. A thing.",

    "I'd always meant to ask Primrose if there was something in the books, something that might have been unleashed when Megan burned them.",
    "But Primrose and I were kept apart by Megan. We never had the chance to talk like we did...before.",
    "Was this Thing in Megan from the books? Ah, why did I never ask her?",

    "I never told Megan how much a Returning hurt. It didn't just sap the energy of the Needle - it sapped from me, too.",
    "I would sleep, propped up next to The Needle. It would give off a little heat as it recharged, and it felt like it was doing the same to me.",

    "Megan never understood why Primrose was getting progressively ill after each Returning. She would wind back in time, and everything would revert apart from the illness.",
    "At first she despaired, but that progressed to anger. It was a cruel fate that denied Primrose her health. Even time was fighting against her.",
    "Just one more Returning, she would say. One more would make it right.",
    "But Primrose was following Megan every time. Primrose was committed to ending her mother's pain.",

    "There wasn't much left of Primrose any more. She found strength to make it up to the hilltop - she found it from somewhere - but she was rarely awake otherwise.",
    "Often, I would let myself into the house as both Megan and Primrose were asleep. Buckthorn berry makes a rudimentary salve, and I would apply it to Primrose as she dreamed.",
    "It eased her pain, but there was no stopping her fate.",
    "I couldn't stay for long in the house, not only because I might get caught, but because I felt I was being watched. Someone, some Thing...staring at me.",

    "Primrose had been there, without fail for the past three Returns.",
    "Every time, The Needle took all three of us back, and every time Primrose rushed to be in bed before her mother arrived.",
    "Megan never saw her, never thought that Primrose might have been following her. All Megan saw was a cruel fate - a daughter getting progressively ill within a time loop.",
    "But Primrose was on the verge of dying. It was time to say no to Megan and begin what must be begun.",

    "Primrose fainted loudly, crashing into the buckthorn. Megan turned and I couldn't stop her from running to her.",
    "Megan assumed the worst. She was panicking, shaking Primrose. She couldn't sense life as I could, and there was a thread of it still in Primrose.",
    "Megan was convinced that Primrose was dead, and I couldn't convince her otherwise.",
    "It is cruel to think it, but I believe that Megan wanted it to be true in some way. Deep down, she wanted to end this loop she had created for herself.",
    "That was when I saw the knife in her hand.",

    "The buckthorn is a versatile bush. Its berries can be crushed and heated to make a salve, while its leaves can be used like a smelling salt, waking up the unconscious.",
    "And it makes for a great hiding spot, of course! Primrose proved that every Returning, keeping well away from Megan.",
    "Is it ironic that Primrose fainted on it? I'm not sure I have a handle on irony yet.",

    "Buckthorn...",
    "Give me some time to get my wind back. Wake Primrose. The buckthorn leaf will do that for you. And please, do what you can for Megan.",
    "Buckthorn...",
    "Megan, I haven't been honest with you. I knew what Primrose was doing, but didn't feel it was my place to intervene. I'm still not sure if I made the right decision. But we are here, the decision was made, and Primrose does not have long. You have three options, Megan. You take the time that Primrose has remaining, and you bring her as much joy as you possibly can. Enjoy your days together, but they will be days. Perhaps less. The second is to allow you The Returning, just one last time. Although I denied you it, it was because you were not yourself. It would allow you one last month. But there is a dishonesty in that, and Primrose is unsure of you in that time. It may not be the release you are looking for. The third option may be the least satisfying for you. But it may save Primrose. It would require a great sacrifice from you. I told you that the Needle could not go back further than 30 days. That is not entirely true. It can go back further, years in fact. But that comes with a terrible cost. You become one with the Needle, you become subsumed by it. Whomever goes back becomes its warden, its keeper. They are strong when it is strong, they are weak when it is weak. We could send Primrose back, years in the past. She would be paired with The Needle, but she would also share its strength. She would be healed. But she would also have no memory of you or her own past. she would be a newborn in terms of the mind. I ask you, Megan: would you let her die now, in a month's time, or be reborn with no memory of you?",
    "I understand. Could you both wait in the house. This won't take long."
