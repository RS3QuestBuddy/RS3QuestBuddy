Rennard the Thief: Valdez will tell you where to find Rennard. The location of all the subsequent ghosts is randomised but is hinted by the previous ghost. Rennard will be in one of the following places. If you go to the wrong location, a ghost will be there but you will have a meaningless conversation with it.`
Shipwrecked ship up in level 55 Wilderness (between Wilderness Agility Course and Pirates' Hideout)`
Bandit Camp (Wilderness), he can be found outside Fat Tony's pizza shop. You need to be skulled or the bandits will attack you.`
Bandit Camp (Kharidian Desert), he can be found in the Bar.`
When you find him he will just be called 'Mysterious Ghost' again (as with the rest of the ghosts). He will give you a pair of Ghostly gloves.`
It is recommended that you use the Drop Trick for extra gloves, because getting deep into the wilderness takes time.`
He wants you to find Kharrim now.`
Kharrim the Messenger: Inside Chaos Temple (hut) Altar in (far west side of) level 38 Wilderness, North of The Forgotten Cemetery. (Rennard will say near Dareeyak)`
Graveyard of Shadows (Wilderness, Carrallanger); if you get this location, the zombies and ghosts will be aggressive and will interrupt your conversation. It may take a while to get your conversation finished.`
End of the Lava Maze (Wilderness) you will need a knife or other sharp object to cut through web.`
Special note: If you go to a different location than the one Rennard tells you, you will not get the boots and instead you will have a normal conversation and nothing to do with the story. Head to this location and talk to Kharrim. He will give you some Ghostly boots and ask you to find Lennissa.`
From him you learn that Zamorak was a mortal Mahjarrat, and that what he did with the Staff of Armadyl caused the "other gods" to banish him, although Saradomin must have had foreknowledge of the mysterious event.`
Lennissa the Spy: Entrana church (Kharrim will say she will have went to a large church of Saradomin). Remember to bring your ring of visibility and ghostspeak amulet (or cramulet) if you have to bank everything to enter Entrana.`
Port Sarim at the Lady Lumbridge (hard to see against the dock)`
Gnomeball field, near the southern viewing platform.`
Once at one of these places, look for Lennissa and speak to her. She will give you the Ghostly robe bottom and ask you to find Dhalak.`
Dhalak the Magician: Wizard's Tower, on the eastern side of the 1st floor[US] near the wall, close to four floating bookcases (Lennissa will say he will be researching in a library)`
2nd floor[US] of the Edgeville Monastery (31 Prayer required) by the altar (Lennissa says he would be trying to lift the curse)`
Falador Party Room, 2nd floor[US] on the eastern side (Lennissa will say that he needed to lift his spirits up)`
Once found, talk to Dhalak. He should give you the Ghostly hood and tell you to find the last ghost, Viggora.`
Viggora the Warrior: Rogues' Castle in the Wilderness, 2nd floor[US] in the small easternmost room with a bronze square shield spawn and three safes. Dhalak will say a rogue flocks to his own kind.`
Beware of the Chaos Elemental.`
Canifis Slayer Tower - "...has returned to his castle in the Dark Lands" (Near the southeast stairwell by the entrance to the Aberrant Spectres on the 2nd floor[US]. Note: This location no longer requires a nosepeg or slayer helmet since the interior redesign locking the specters away.`
Paddewwa - Edgeville dungeon "perhaps he has returned to one of his old haunts?" (south of the Earth warriors)`
Viggora now spawns just south of the monkey bars. The earth warriors used to interrupt the dialogue, but this is no longer the case. Instead, skeletons may now interrupt the dialogue. The skeletons may be trapped behind the column and rocks to the south.`
Listen to what he has to say and then he will give you the final robe piece, the Ghostly cloak.`
