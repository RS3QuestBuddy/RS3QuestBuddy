  "Awusah the Mayor": [
    "Many salutations to you [sir/madam], what brings you to our little town?",
    "Hmm, well that could be quite fortuitous. We really could do with some help here. Our town seems to have come under a curse, and we are desperate to get it removed.",
    "Well first of all our fountain, which has served us for many years, suddenly dried up. We then started transporting water from the river, but what we carried would always have completely dried up by the time we got it back to the village.",
    "Well it's tough. There is a guy who calls himself Malik the carter down in the market. He's from Pollnivneach, so the curse doesn't seem to have affected him. He's got a cart full of water which he's selling to the people here.",
    "Unfortunately in typical Pollnivneach style he's taking the opportunity to sell the water at outrageous prices because he knows we are desperate. Oh and Rokuh has developed something quite remarkable, called a choc ice which is helping people stay cool.",
    "Well we think it was because we were negligent in our duty to protect a priest of Saradomin. He came to us a few weeks ago from the north and we welcomed him into our town. He taught us much of the wisdom of Saradomin.",
    "Then about a week ago, we found him dead by the river. It seems unlikely that it is coincidence we were then cursed. If you look around the town you might be able to find out more.",
    "Good luck to you.",
    "Well we've not fallen on the best of times here, but there are a few shops to look around and we have someone selling a marvelous new invention called a choc ice..[sic] Oh, and there's the old temple if you're interested in a bit of history.",
    "Oh you don't want to go there at the moment. I hear rumours of plagues and the like down there, I think they've closed off the city anyway.",
    "Many salutations to you [sir/madam], have you made any progress in uncovering the reasons for our curse yet?",
    "Please try your best, that water salesman is not doing much good for the economy of our town.",
    "Look around this town, see if you can uncover any information to why we were cursed and how the curse might be lifted. I suspect that it might be because a priest of Saradomin died while staying at our town, but that isn't much help in getting the curse lifted and it is possible I'm wrong anyway.",
    "Well I hope somebody can find the time soon, the despair of the people of this town increases daily.",
    "Many salutations to you [sir/madam], have you made any progress in uncovering the reasons for our curse yet?",
    "The Spirits of the Elid? I wasn't even sure if they weren't some old wives tale. Why would they do such a thing?",
    "Oh that old thing. Yeah, the priest of Saradomin said we should get rid of that. He said we should become followers of Saradomin, and therefore we wouldn't need it.",
    "Gasps!",
    "Ohh that's not so good if only we hadn't thrown the statue away, we wouldn't have this water problem then. He was a very convincing priest though. He worked many wonders, for example if he prayed hard enough he became impervious to arrows. The way of Saradomin did seem very appealing.",
    "Then truly you are very powerful too!",
    "Ohh there's a strange deep crevice in the desert to the west of here. We threw it down there. I don't know if it's lost forever or not.",
    "If you could retrieve it for us we'll be very grateful. Even if it doesn't give us our water back, maybe it'll calm Shiratti down, she was not pleased at it being thrown away and she's been grumpy ever since.",
    "Have you had any luck retrieving our statuette yet?",
    "Good luck, may Sarad..[sic] errm I mean Elidinis guide you.",
    "In a deep crevice to the west of this village.",
    "Have you had any luck retrieving our statuette yet?",
    "What! That's just asking too much. So, he wants to have my soul when my time to die comes?",
    "That's barbaric! I simply refuse. The price is too high. We'll just have to find other ways to get the town a good supply of water. Don't go bringing any knives near me.",
    "What do you think you are doing?",
    "What, have you lost your mind?",
    "That's barbaric! We'll just have to find other ways to get the town a good supply of water. Keep your knife away from me please.",
    "Hey, leave my shoes alone!",
    "Have you had any luck retrieving our statuette yet?",
    "I suppose sacrificing a pair of shoes for the greater good of the town is reasonable. I don't begin to understand the ways of genies.",
    "Anyway thanks for getting the statue back. You should take it to our temple and then we can see if our fountain starts working again.",
    "Have you had any luck retrieving our statuette yet?",
    "That is not so good. You had best refind it then. I tend to find in life things often return to where you first got them."

  "Player": [
    "I am an adventurer in search of quests.",
    "A curse? What sort of curse?",
    "So what do you do for water now?",
    "Any idea how you got this curse?",
    "I'm sorry to hear of your plight, but I must be going.",
    "Ok I will have a look around and see what I can do.",
    "I'm sorry to hear of your plight, but I must be going.",
    "I'm just looking around.",
    "I'm passing through on my way to Menaphos.",
    "Thanks for the warnings, though I may go investigate there anyway.",
    "I am working on it.",
    "What was I meant to do again?",
    "I haven't really had the time to investigate.",
    "I am trying to find out the cause of this town's curse.",
    "That's extortionate! Why so much?",
    "Would you happen to know anything about the curse?",
    "It does seem to be slightly exploiting their unfortunate situation.",
    "Hi, I am trying to find the cause of the curse on your town.",
    "Don't you know? The curse that has stopped your fountain working and made all the water dry up when you bring it back from the river?",
    "So any ideas about the cause of the curse?",
    "Hi, I am trying to find the cause of the curse on your town.",
    "Hi, I am trying to find the cause of the curse on your town.",
    "Hi, I am trying to find the cause of the curse on your town.",
    "Yes he has.",
    "I am trying to find out the cause of this town's curse.",
    "Why, what have they been up to?",
    "Good day to you.",
    "Ok calm down,  I'm not going to touch anything.",
    "What is this building?",
    "What do you mean by She?",
    "Errm you still haven't told me what you mean by She.",
    "That all sounds very confusing, I might just call her Elidinis for short.",
    "What is that key on display?",
    "..I just wanted to know what it did.",
    "I am trying to find out the cause of this town's curse.",
    "River spirits, what are they?",
    "So would it be possible for me to find these spirits and ask them what is going on?",
    "Thank you very much for your help.",
    "Thank you very much for your help.",
    "Thanks for your help.",
    "How are things?",
    "Well I hope things pick up for you.",
    "Thats odd. I wonder what I can have forgotten.",
    "Wow, how do you finish each other's sentences like that?",
    "That doesn't really have the same ring to it.",
    "Give Nardah its water back!",
    "Who are you calling little?",
    "Just tell me what it takes to get Nardah some water.",
    "Tell me what I need and I'll leave.",
    "Look, you don't want me to get annoyed.",
    "Okay, yes, I'm annoyed. Now give them their water.",
    "I haven't time for this nonsense.",
    "Yes, it wasn't so easy getting in here. Why have you made it so tough? You must really not like guests.",
    "I come as an emissary from the people of Nardah. Their fountain has dried up and water they bring from the river dries up. What advice can you give on this matter?",
    "Was this due to the death of the Saradominist priest, as the townspeople think?",
    "Is there anything they can do to get their fountain working again?",
    "Well, that's all very interesting. I wonder what the people of Nardah will think of this.",
    "Hey, you've stopped finishing each other's sentences!",
    "There are other desert settlements that don't worship Elidinis. Why pick on Nardah specifically?",
    "Yes, I would like to hear this story.",
    "That does make some sense.",
    "What manner of beings are you?",
    "Tell me more of Elidinis.",
    "Give Nardah its water back!",
    "Yes, it's nice and cool here.",
    "What did the townspeople need to do again?",
    "Yes I have made some progress. It is the doing of the water spirits at the source of the river.",
    "Did you by any chance throw away a statuette of the goddess Elidinis recently?",
    "Well the spirits killed him for imparting that piece of advice about the statuette.",
    "Apparently this town was brought about by Elidinis on the promise that its people would follow her. People here have been waning in their belief of Elidinis for a while now.",
    "It seems the casting away of the statue was the final straw.",
    "Oh but that's easy, I can pray to protect myself from arrows too.",
    "Where did you throw the statuette?",
    "Well it's worth a look anyway.",
    "Not yet, but don't give up hope yet.",
    "Where did you say you threw it again?",
    "I'm told that a statuette was removed from this temple.",
    "Who?",
    "..Ah yes, that She. Well you're right, that would be an insult to Elidinis. In fact it seems that affront is what has brought the curse upon this village.",
    "Er, why didn't you tell me about your suspicions when I was asking around about the curse then?",
    "No I'm here to help.",
    "Yes some actually. I managed to speak to the river spirits you told me about.",
    "Yes the spirits told me that the town is cursed because you guys have thrown away a statuette to the goddess Elidinis.",
    "I heard the people of Nardah threw their statue of Elidinis away.",
    "Where did it go?",
    "I heard the people of Nardah threw their statue of Elidinis away.",
    "But the spirits of the Elid have cursed Nardah for throwing the statue away. Where did you throw it?",
    "I heard the people of Nardah threw their statue of Elidinis away.",
    "A Saradominist priest who was staying here told them too[sic].",
    "You don't seem to notice much. Do you even live here?",
    "I heard the people of Nardah threw their statue of Elidinis away.",
    "I've found out that action seems to have caused this town's curse.",
    "I'm after a statue that was thrown down here.",
    "Maybe I can make a deal for the statuette?",
    "Isn't that a little harsh?",
    "How am I meant to remove someone's soul?",
    "Ok I agree to the deal.",
    "No way am I agreeing to that.",
    "I'm not sure they know you're down here.",
    "You're a genie, grant me a wish.",
    "Well you seem quite scary.",
    "Erm yes that's what I meant.",
    "Well I must be off now.",
    "Why are you sitting here in the dark?",
    "Very pleasant, the snakes are a nice touch.",
    "I'm just looking around.",
    "...Ok I think I can manage that.",
    "How am I meant to remove someone's soul?",
    "I'm still working on it.",
    "No, it's not an easy thing to get.",
    "Err, well I have made some progress. I met a genie down the crevice. He told me that he would give me the statuette in exchange for your soul.",
    "Well not exactly, he sort of basically said I should remove it with a knife.",
    "Errm, I'm trying to remove your soul.",
    "It's for the good of the village. I met a genie down the crevice. He told me that he would give me the statuette in exchange for your sole.",
    "Yes I have it here.",
    "So um, why do you need part of Awusah's footwear anyway? I hope you're not going to do some nasty magic on his feet or something.",
    "I have lost my statuette.",
    "I will go and get one then.",
    "Yes I have one here.",
    "Yes I finally got it. I had to destroy a pair of your shoes though. A crazy genie wanted a sole off your shoe in return for the statuette. I think he got souls and soles confused.",
    "Yes I thought it best not to correct him. He's somewhat less dangerous than he might be if he's a collector of shoe soles.",
    "Well I did, but I lost it again.",
    "I have recovered the statuette of Elidinis.",
    "I have got the statuette.",
    "Well I found the statuette, but I lost it again."

  "Malik the Carter": [
    "Water, water get your fresh water here, 1000 coins a waterskin, a bargain in these difficult times.",
    "Well it's the cheapest water you'll find in this town.",
    "Yes the people round here can't seem to get the water themselves. It's an ideal business opportunity for one such as myself.",
    "I don't see it like that. Without me they'd be in even more of a mess. I'm doing them a favour and in true Pollnivneachian spirit making a profit along the way."

    "What curse is that?",
    "Ohh that's because of a curse? I didn't think of that.",
    "Absolutely none.",

    "There was a Saradominist priest here?",

  "Nkuku": [
    "It's terrible isn't it. Surely it is because we let the holy Saradominist priest die.",

    "Ah I see. Awusah has enlisted your help?",
    "Well, I really dont know why it might have happened. Maybe Ghaslor has some ideas. He's very wise and old and is the town's archivist. He lives in the northeast corner of the town.",
    "Yes that's correct. Why do you ask?",
    "Well, I guess that would be logical conclusion. I don't really know where the statue was thrown. Awusah might know."

  "Shiratti the Custodian": [
    "Well with the moral standards of this town lately, I'm hardly surprised.",
    "Nothing someone like you would understand.",
    "Be Careful[sic] in here and don't touch anything! There's some old and valuable artefacts around here. Careless outsiders..[sic] you're always coming in and making a mess of things!",
    "Yes, good don't.",
    "This is our local shrine to She.",
    "Such ignorance! I suppose I should come to expect it. People are forgetting the old ways of the desert around here. But then..[sic] What do those bureaucratic fools in Menaphos expect! If they're going to take so long to send us a new priestess of She. Do you know we haven't had one for five years now!",
    "She! Otherwise known as Elidinis, Goddess of growth and fertility, Lady of the river, Wife of Tumeken, Flower of the desert, Mother of Icthlarin.",
    "That's a very valuable artefact. Keep your hands off it.",
    "That's the key to the holy chambers of the great and mighty Spirits of the Elid, and it's staying right there. There are other holy items about this building and keep your hands off them too, but most definitely keep your hands off the key. People already meddle too much with the affairs of the shrine.",
    "Yes, that Saradominist priest brought a group of the villagers in here. Took it by force as far as I'm concerned. I'm not at all happy, standards have been slipping here for a while, but that was going too far.",
    "It's an insult to She!",
    "She! Elidinis! Goddess of growth and fertility! Lady of the River, Wife of Tumeken, Flower of the Desert. Mother of Icthlarin!",
    "Well you know I suspected that all along, but does anyone listen to me anymore? No! Well I'm impressed you've come to the same conclusion as me, maybe I underestimated you.",
    "I have to apologise. We've already had one outsider around stirring trouble, which caused this whole mess in the first place. I feared that you were coming to force your ways on us.",
    "Well I'm grateful, anything you can to do to find the statuette would be appreciated.",
    "That is great news! I could kiss you, but they don't allow shrine custodians to engage in that sort of behaviour. You should put the statuette back on its plinth.",
    "That is not good. I hope you find it again so that we can be freed from this awful curse."

  "Ghaslor the Elder": [
    "Good day to you young [man/lady].",
    "Oh that's something which no one but the gods and the river spirits seem to know.",
    "They're the guardians of the source of the river Elid, they'll know of our curse, seeing as it's related to water we bring from the river. It's said that nothing happens on the river that they don't know about.",
    "Ahh now the spirits are something which no one from here have seen in a good long time, certainly not in my lifetime, I don't think even in my own grandfather's lifetime. Most the younger people of this town don't even remember that the spirits even exist.",
    "Here I have something around here somewhere which may be of interest to you.",
    "Aha yes here it is, the ballad of Jareesh. This tells of a previous quest to try and find the spirits.",
    "You already have the ballad of Jareesh, which tells of a previous quest to try and find the spirits.",
    "Lousy, young people have no respect for their elders, there's too many confusing newfangled magic carpets and snake charmers around these days and now we don't even have any water.",
    "Good day to you young [man/lady].",
    "Any progress on uncovering the town's curse yet?",
    "You actually managed to find them? I'm impressed. As I say \u2013 no one has seen them in many many years.",
    "Ah yes I heard a group led by that Saradominist priest went into the shrine and removed the Statuette. It all seemed a bit unnecessary to me. Didn't realise it would curse us though.",
    "I have no idea what they did with it afterwards."

Saradominist mages even gave us those golems you met as a diplomatic gesture, so you can see we have been on good terms; however, this is an outrage.",

    "Do you have the sole of Awusah, so that we can make our trade?",

    "I hadn't thought of that. I just read that a lot of the most powerful beings are collecting soles these days. I haven't really got many yet though. You provided me with an opportunity to expand my collection.",
    "Well fortunately for you, I am a mighty and powerful genie and managed to reacquire it. I will give it to you for another sole.",
    "Great! Another one for my collection.",
    "Ah excellent here's the statuette then.",
    "It's good doing business with you again."
