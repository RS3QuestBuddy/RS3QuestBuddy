  "Player": [
    "Thanks, Pete, see you later.",
    "Not right now.",
    "Aaarrrrrr!",
    "I dunno, I thought you might be an...'Aaaarrrmadeeelean'.",
    "So, how are things?",
    "I mean, how are you? Everything good? How are the wife and kids?",
    "That's...yeah, I have no idea what that's even supposed to mean.",
    "Still catching pirates?",
    "You mean their rehabilitation, right?",
    "Why are you saying that in such a creepy monotone?",
    "That's...that's not even an answer. So, moving on...",
    "You look a little pale, are you coming down with something?",
    "But it's warm and sunny outside.",
    "Touch\u00e9.",
    "I would like to confess!",
    "What?",
    "Yeah...no...sorry, I don't think of you like that.",
    "...",
    "Err...well...this is awkward now...",
    "Really? No one? Ever? No one who looks eerily familiar?",
    "Hey! You! Let me out!",
    "I was so sure that would work.",
    "That's a lot of angry looking crabs. Those pincers look frighteningly sharp. I wonder if I can make any sort of convoluted use of that...",
    "Pssst.",
    "SHHHH! Over here!",
    "By which you mean pirate.",
    "You're fooling no one. You have the stereotype 'arr' compulsion and everything.",
    "Where?",
    "Hello?",
    "I asked you that...",
    "No, that's why I asked you.",
    "Are you just copying me?",
    "Psssst, Bill! Over here.",
    "I got your letter. I take it your investigations didn't go well?",
    "What's going on?",
    "Any idea how we get out of here?",
    "On it! Hold tight, I won't be long.",
    "What am I doing?",
    "Well, hey. Look who's going to rot in their cell for the rest of time.",
    "Don't suppose you know what's going on?",
    "Curses! Arbitrarily squishing random objects against this door has failed to grant me freedom!",
    "No, you can't.",
    "Urgh, FINE! I mean, you do realise there's a massive hole behind me, so escaping is trivial, right?",
    "What? Dee-de-dee, nothing to see here.",
    "Hrmm, this gives me an idea, but I need a creature other than a rat to distract these guards.",
    "This is accomplishing nothing. I'm not sure why I thought it would.",
    "Baron von Hattenkrapper?",
    "Ow! The little blighters nipped my fingers and I've dropped the hook. I wonder if Eric has any spares.",
    "Sharpening it further might tear open a hole in the fabric of the universe. Probably best not.",
    "I offer this sacrifice to thee, oh mighty crab overlords.",
    "Well, that was fruitless. Oh no! I dropped the hook in with the fish. I regret all my decisions.",
    "I dread to think what these crabs would do with such an offering.",
    "Erm...something useful?",
    "Hrmm. I could probably get more mileage out of that fish if I didn't just throw it down a gull's throat.",
    "Without the seagull, this is just a rock. I probably can't get much more use out it. Best let it be.",
    "Chinchompa blood can't melt steel beams!",
    "I'm lonely and confused and like shouting for no reason!",
    "If Gielinor isn't flat,how come water doesn't roll away?",
    "The Great Brain Robbery was an inside job!",
    "There was a second stabber at Zamorak's ascension!",
    "That achieved nothing, but I did enjoy it.",
    "Ah, sweet freedom.",
    "What now?",
    "I should probably deal with the guards before I try to pick any more locks.",
    "I have all the crate I could ever need right now.",
    "There's nothing more in here except...urgh...why are there barnacles growing on the inside of this thing?",
    "I'm not sure what use that would be right now.",
    "I probably shouldn't risk being captured by the guards.",
    "Moving these would let the guards back in, which seems counterproductive.",
    "What now?",
    "I should try and set Bill free first.",
    "Oh, come on! How am I going to get the doors open now?",
    "Pssst.",
    "SHHHH! Over here!",
    "Er, right, fine, I'll think of something else.",
    "Nope. Stop talking. I'm... Nope. Nope, nope.",
    "Big fish, little fish, wooden box... Nope, all this does is give me ideas for a dance move.",
    "Mmmm, a delicious raw fish sandwich...",
    "Oh, dear. I think I'm gonna throw up. *Hlerg huey blehrgle*.",
    "Rats don't really like fish, do they?",
    "Hmm, he doesn't seem interested in fish.",
    "While this guard outfit is an unforgivable fashion sin, I don't think boxing it up and throwing it away is helpful right now.",
    "Though, it is really tempting.",
    "Should I stir the outfit? Hide a spoon up a sleeve? Eat the hat? None of this seems like a sensible plan right now.",
    "That seems like it would be a horrible sandwich...",
    "Hrmm, I don't quite think this works as bait.",
    "I've been told off for trying to squeeze random things into tight holes before.",
    "That seems like it would be a horrible sandwich...",
    "Odd, the rat doesn't appear to just want to leap into the box.",
    "That seems like it would be a horrible sandwich...",
    "I've been told off for trying to squeeze random things into tight holes before.",
    "I don't need a packed lunch just yet. But I get the sense that I'm on the right track, just missing a step. Hrmmm.",
    "Ouch! The little blighter stole the sandwich from me. If only I had some way of catching it.",
    "You bait the trap with a delicious cheese sandwich. It's almost irresistible.",
    "I cannot for the life of me think what value a pineapple in a box could offer in this situation.",
    "While it looks delicious, I think I need to use this pineapple somewhere else.",
    "It's a bit big to add to the sandwich.",
    "Is pineapple really the best bait for a rat trap?",
    "OI! YOU IN THE HOLE! GIVE ME THE HOOK BACK!",
    "DON'T YOU IGNORE ME!",
    "Meow!",
    "Meow?",
    "Meow...",
    "AHA! Got you!",
    "You're an ugly little ball of hate, aren't you!",
    "Hey there. Calm down, little buddy. Let's talk through this.",
    "Welp, that didn't work.",
    "Look, you. I'll be having none of this uppity nonsense. You and I are going to have a nice civil chat. Okay?",
    "No, you little...rat! What do you think you're doing stealing from me? Don't you know who I am?",
    "Charge! Go forth my ratty minion and destroy the guards!",
    "Right, give me the hook back, you horrible little rodent!",
    "So that would be an no then?",
    "Look, I'll level with you. We're all trapped on this tiny island with some really weirdly acting guards. People keep being taken away and then are never seen again. And there's something very strange about the guards down here.",
    "Here you go, little guy, have a nice little treat.",
    "Oh, I'm sorry, how terribly rude of me. My name is Player, it's a pleasure to meet you.",
    "It's a pleasure to meet you, Wilson",
    "Though, I'm not sure how I know your name is Wilson.",
    "Wait, what? What was that?",
    "Can I have the hook back now?",
    "Now my tiny rat minion. Go forth! DESTROY THE GUARDS!",
    "Quick, Wilson, show me the way out. I need to get out of here!",
    "I know, I'm sorry, I'm at terrible person.",
    "Wilson, help me, can you find a way to free my friends?",
    "Thanks, buddy, we've got this!",
    "Who's a cute little rattypoo? You are, yes you are...",
    "Okay, not cute. Very much not cute.",
    "I'm not sure what I was expecting there.",
    "Why won't this pineapple stick to this rat? What's coming to this world when fruit won't magically adhere to rodents?",
    "Yeah, Wilson doesn't seem to like me prodding him with that.",
    "Nothing happens. Why on Gielinor did I think it would?",
    "That seems like it would be a horrible sandwich...",
    "Hrmm, I don't quite think this works as bait.",
    "I'm sorry, you're right, a life behind bars is no place for a little rat like you.",
    "Hey, buddy, ready to break out of prison?",
    "I don't think bellowing into a rat hole is terribly useful.",
    "Meow!",
    "Meow?",
    "Meow...",
    "Okay, good, that's everyone free.",
    "Yeah, me too. Something fishy is going on here and I'm not leaving until I find out what.",
    "OW!  There's some sort of ward on this door, I can't open it.",
    "So, the door is warded in some way.",
    "Sensed?",
    "Okay, Jimmy, before you start repeating everything I say, shut up.",
    "Good lad. Now, I'm going to assume you've heard everything the guards have said. Do you remember the phrase they used before going through the stairwell door?",
    "Good work! When I check the door, I want you to repeat it, okay?",
    "Okay, Jimmy you're up.",
    "Okay, that was creepy, but at least we're through now.",
    "Nope, nope, nope.",
    "Okay. There's a terrible crab-thing guarding the stairs up. I need a way to sneak past it.",
    "Nope, nope, nope.",
    "Rats - locked.",
    "Curses, there's no more 'rum' in here.",
    "Nothing happens. Why on Gielinor did I think it would?",
    "That seems like it would be a horrible sandwich...",
    "I'm not sure there's much point in getting a rodent completely squiffy.",
    "Eeeeeegads, that's some strong stuff. I wonder if there's better uses for it, though.",
    "Maybe if I keep drinking it I'll get superpowers. Or liver poisoning.",
    "Do I have a problem? I mean, I'm in a prison full of monsters and I'm getting drunk?",
    "No, more, please. I'm begging you, oh invisible puppet master, don't make me drink more of this!",
    "Oi, *hic* whosh putsh that there? Shtop being there. Rude.",
    "Heeey *hic* yoush is really pretty. Give Player a kish.",
    "I deserv*hic*ed that.",
    "Hyuuuurrrrgh.",
    "Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz",
    "Oh gods, I feel so unwell.",
    "Dang, doesn't fit the lock.",
    "Dang, doesn't fit. I mean, maybe If I wish really, really hard and keep pushing it at the lock it'll work?",
    "I don't think this would make much of a distraction.",
    "There's a guard in that room. I don't think he'll fall for my disguise at all.",
    "I'm not sure I want to get that sticky right now.",
    "Nothing happens. Why on Gielinor did I think it would?",
    "That seems like it would be a horrible sandwich...",
    "Okay little buddy, I have a plan. It's a weird plan, but go with it, okay?",
    "There's nothing under here but dust and a rather angry-looking spider...",
    "While I do love me a fried egg, I should probably get out of here.",
    "Hrmm, this 'rum' does seem quite strong, I could probably set fire to these eggs.",
    "That should prove an appropriate distraction.",
    "I'm not sure what you... I mean, I... Existential crisis... WE? That'll work. I'm not sure what we're trying to accomplish here with that.",
    "We've got to go. NOW! Everyone, to the jetty, we can swim from there.",
    "Have some respect, they might be dead. If it wasn't for Eric and Jimmy we'd have never made it out of that prison.",
    "You're right, they were weak.",
    "We're on the coast of Karamja.",
    "Well, that was a surprisingly pleasant trip, almost no attempts at mutiny. I should go meet up with Bill in the secret basement.",
    "A Long Drop.",
    "Aye. Drop me...",
    "Aaaaah!",
    "Er, nothing?",
    "Okay, that's enough, guys. We have bigger fish to fry than noxious odours.",
    "We just escaped from the Customs and Excise prison, where they appear to be working with Mi-Gor to transform people somehow.",
    "AND Mi-Gor was talking to someone he referred to as his superior, which I think we can all agree can only be one person.",
    "If only there were one of those undead pirates with us now... Someone who was once a loyal soldier... Perhaps even one of the barrelchest monstrosities and has now been...rehabilitated.",
    "That, Madame Shih, is the information source we need. So, my decomposing friend, you're going to tell us everything we need to know!",
    "So, my decomposing friend, you're going to tell us everything we need to know!",
    "Okay, you sorry excuse for a head. You're going to tell me what I want to know, or you're going to be sorry!",
    "You're enjoying it?",
    "Okay, okay, I think we're starting on the wrong foot. We can be reasonable about this.",
    "I like your makeup, it's very...er...cute?",
    "Why don't pirates shower before they walk the plank?",
    "Because they'll just wash up on shore later!",
    "Why is piracy so addictive?",
    "They say once you lose yer first hand, ye get HOOKED!",
    "I know, I'm a terrible person.",
    "How do philosopher pirates know that they're pirates? They think, therefore they ARRRRRRRR!",
    "Did you hear what happened to the pirate that fell into the Red Sea? He got MAROONED!",
    "Errr, go past the fourth wall and turn left?",
    "How did the pirate get his Jolly Roger so cheaply? He bought it on a sail!",
    "I regret nothing. I still have more.",
    "What has eight arms, eight legs and eight eyes?",
    "EIGHT pirates!",
    "What lies at the bottom of the ocean and twitches?",
    "Oh, you know that one.",
    "How much did the pirate pay for his piercings? A buck 'n' ear!",
    "It's a joke, don't overthink how it fits into the canon.",
    "Canon, not cannon.",
    "Never mind.",
    "Where can you find a pirate who has lost his wooden legs? Right where you left him!",
    "Why did nobody want to play cards with the pirate? Because they were standing on the deck!",
    "When you've just got back into Mos Le'Harmless after a long voyage and you're hungry and broke, you know what's criminal? The pie-rates!",
    "Have you heard about the cannoneer that couldn't stop messing around on the job?",
    "He got fired!",
    "Oh, that actually happened to someone? Sorry...",
    "Why was the pirate banned from boxing?",
    "That's... actually better than what I was going to say.",
    "Nah, I'm no boxer myself, I couldn't deliver a better PUNCH line that that.",
    "Why can't you tell when the Eastern pirates get food poisoning?",
    "Because they have invisible salmon-ella!",
    "Err...that may be a little beyond my power.",
    "We could visit a pet shop, sure.",
    "Okay, that's one. What's the other thing?",
    "Do your worst!",
    "Didn't I just say that?",
    "Really? This is your tactic, repeating everything I say?",
    "What is this, interrogation by five-year-old?",
    "Lemons are just oranges that failed in life!",
    "Oh, ho! I see. I know who wore the green jumper - I KNOW, I KNOW!",
    "The world is flat! If it was round we'd all fall off!",
    "MAY THE RATS EAT YOUR EYES! THE DARKNESS COMES!",
    "My worst? Oh dear, how unfortunate for you. Such a proposal, why it fills me with such monstrous whimsy.",
    "I could tease you with just enough bare hints of lore that you feel you are on the cusp of the answers you so seek...",
    "And then I rip that joy away with an answer just vague enough to be meaningless.",
    "A monster? Oh, my dear zombie head, you haven't even begun to dream of the cruelties I could inflict upon you.",
    "Tell me. Is there anyone you care about? A friend...a lover...an ally in all of Gielinor that you want to see do well?",
    "Because I could tear them from you! I could submit them to the cruellest of torture and feast deeply on their delicious tears.",
    "The tears of agony are the sweetest, I think. Suffering, and just the subtlest hint of hope.",
    "I love hope. The most exquisite of torture devices. People will suffer so much longer, so much deeper, if they believe there is hope.",
    "But you shouldn't have hope, my friend. Oh no. No hope for you, you see I'm going to...no...I better not say...",
    "Spoilers!",
    "CURSES!",
    "I'll talk to you later.",
    "No yet, we're in a secret location now, it's time to tell us everything zombie head.",
    "Focus.",
    "Where's this island? Can you take us there?",
    "How's Wilson settling in?",
    "I don't see him.",
    "I may throw up.",
    "Hi, Gertrude. Don't suppose you have any more kittens lying about do you? My friend here would really like one.",
    "Soooo...kittens? Do you have any kittens?",
    "Okay, thanks, I'll go have a chat with them.",
    "Hey there fellow kids.",
    "Your mother tells me that you've found an adorable fluffy critter for my friend here?",
    "Hi there.",
    "Oh, come on, not this again. I mean, yes, of course you are. Oh, terrible and powerful dwag...dragon. Your mother tells me that you've found another kitten?",
    "Yes, yes, terrible monster. Where is this monster?",
    "The sawmill. It's at the sawmill isn't it?",
    "Where did you say the kitten was again?",
    "Sawmill, yep, got it. Thanks.",
    "Hi there.",
    "Your mother tells me that you've found another kitten!",
    "Small cat. Cute and cuddly?",
    "Of course that's where it is. Why didn't I just go straight there?",
    "Symmetry. Never mind, come on, we're off to the kid's hideout.",
    "Just east of here, it's an abandoned house near the Apothecary.",
    "Where did you say the kitten was again?",
    "Sawmill, yep, got it. Thanks.",
    "Oh, Wilson, thank the stars it's you! Why are you sticky?",
    "Oh, the pineapple thing. Yeah, sorry about that.",
    "I'm sorry we left you in that prison, but we needed to escape.",
    "I know you're angry, but that is no way to talk about my mother!",
    "Why are you so MEAN?",
    "What? Did I miss something here?",
    "I said I was sorry.",
    "You're just a head...",
    "Right, and he's a rat. A rat that smells of pineapple.",
    "Confusing perfumes?",
    "How exactly?",
    "Why exactly?",
    "It's not like you're going to go very far... Okay, fine, I'll get the leather and the gold. I'll be back here shortly.",
    "Which I just so happen to have on me!",
    "Would you believe divine providence?",
    "Hi, Wilson, I'm back.",
    "What?",
    "I forgot the stuff, didn't I?",
    "I'll...er...I'll come back with two pieces of leather and a gold bar.",
    "Also, you're in my backpack...",
    "Swimming with dolphins?",
    "Build the mightiest sandcastle ever known?",
    "Amazing. Every word of what you just said was wrong. Fine, what do you want to drink?",
    "That's...very specific.",
    "I'll see what I can do.",
    "I've brought you a Blurberry Special. It's made from all the ingredients you like, plus it has that leafy citrus flavour.",
    "Really? You couldn't have said that earlier?",
    "Sooo, I happen to already have one of those on me.",
    "I always come prepared.",
    "I think I will hold onto it for now.",
    "I've brought you a Drunk Dragon. It's got pineapple and dwellberries in it and it's mixed in with cream.",
    "Oh, come on, really?",
    "Well, what do you know, I've got a Chocolate Saturday on me right now.",
    "I'd say that this fits all your criteria.",
    "I think I will hold onto it for now.",
    "I've brought you a Chocolate Saturday. It should meet all your alcoholic needs.",
    "Yes, it is. I've always thought so.",
    "It helps to be drunk as well, of course.",
    "No, it's horrible! I hate it!",
    "But the darkness creeps in and eclipses the light. Anything could be hiding in those shadows. ANYTHING!",
    "Everyone...",
    "Meh.",
    "It happens every day, no biggie.",
    "I think I will hold onto it for now.",
    "What books are you reading?",
    "Whatever. So you're going to tell me about Rabid Jack's base?",
    "Not yet...but none of these pirates have made a move yet either!",
    "I'll bet it's something to do with the black rock.",
    "This.....",
    "...is...",
    "...going...",
    "...to...",
    "Ow!",
    "I can't abandon the pirates of Mos Le'Harmless to Rabid Jack's forces!",
    "I'm a little busy right now...",
    "There's no fighting over this way.",
    "I've repaired all the barricades!",
    "Let's get you up.",
    "FIRE!",
    "That's one bridge down!",
    "I've destroyed all the bridges!",
    "I've damaged the BF cannon!",
    "I've destroyed the cannon!",
    "I think that's the last of them.",
    "He did leave early into the fight. I did wonder where.",
    "The 'rum'. They're after the 'rum'.",
    "They're planning on turning people into monsters and if they have the distillery...",
    "Not to mention a delivery system. That 'rum' shifts to just about every port in Gielinor.",
    "If we don't stop him, it'll be no more world.",
    "Ruining things is what I do best. Wait, that came out wrong.",
    "Quick! I need to get to Braindeath Island!",
    "How come you're still here, Luke?",
    "But why, there's nothing out there.",
    "Cawing? What, like a crow?",
    "Gulls don't caw, they, um...how do you describe the noise gulls make?",
    "And you're scared of it?",
    "Remind me again what it is that you are made of.",
    "I meant more 'the left stuff'?",
    "Hey!",
    "I said hey...",
    "Hmm, that didn't work.",
    "Oh, yeah, I'll go do my scheming out of earshot. Bye!",
    "Who? Me?",
    "Why's he done that?",
    "What's going on here?",
    "With your 'rum', more like sedated.",
    "What do they want with the distillery?",
    "I've heard all I need to. Better not risk getting spotted.",
    "It's Mi-gor and Mechanical Murphy! They're interrogating Captain Braindeath for his recipe for 'rum'. I suspect they plan to brew a vast batch, mix it with some black stone, and use it to turn masses of people into zombies! Mi-Gor coerced him by pushing the brewers into the fever spider pit one-by-one.",
    "Any suggestion how? Did Braindeath give them anything? That's the odd thing - Braindeath saw me. He looked right at me when he told them the last ingredient was witchwood?",
    "What's Operation Witchwood?",
    "I guess it's worth a shot. I'll find a way to get past Luke.",
    "What?",
    "Huh?",
    "Er, yeah, they were. I was sent on a mission to the mainland.",
    "Er, no. Definitely not him. So...can I go into the distillery?",
    "Ha! Through and through. Good one.",
    "You know, because of how he died?",
    "He took a cannonball to the chest...",
    "Never mind.",
    "Er, sure... He said to, um...",
    "I shall pass on your message to Mi-Gor...",
    "Considering what else goes in it, you're suprised by a bit of wood?",
    "Then that's exactly what you'll do, captain!",
    "Sure, I'll just go do that. Bye!",
    "Nice porthole.",
    "Nice anchor.",
    "Nice wheel.",
    "Doesn't the constant rotating DRVE you nuts?",
    "Oh. Sorry if I SPOKE out of turn.",
    "You know, you're not sucha  bad FELLOE.",
    "...",
    "Nope, I'm out.",
    "Okay, 66.6...% Luke is out of the picture and I can access the north of the island.",
    "I've also gained access to the distillery floor.",
    "Mi-Gor, Murphy and Giles are all 'rum'-soaked, awaiting a good crabbing.",
    "I ran into an old ally who's helped me blow up barrelchests before. They've offered to assist, I just need some explosives.",
    "We're all set on the bombing front too. The Baron has some explosive 'rum' barrels.",
    "On it. You should probably take cover somewhere just to be safe.",
    "Hah, must have been someone else, oh wait, is that the time, gotta go, bye!",
    "Can I get past, please? I need to talk to Mi-Gor.",
    "I'm not carrying anything that would get the job done here.",
    "Hey, this leg would bend perfectly around these pipes! That should stuff up the works!",
    "There's probably a joke here about being legless...but I can't think of one right now.",
    "Here goes nothing...",
    "Right, that's the zombie pirates covered in 'rum'. What was next? Davey will know.",
    "One soaking should suffice.",
    "Hey Luke! Look over there, a three-headed monkey!",
    "Hey Luke! Look an eagle!",
    "Hey Luke! Is that Rabid Jack over there?",
    "Hey Luke! That thing by the trees is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.",
    "Hey Luke! Would you kindly be distracted and look away for a second?",
    "Hey Luke!",
    "Hey, Luke, what's up? Everything good with you?",
    "But your leg, er...",
    "But you're still only half you.",
    "Why 66.6...% Luke, though?",
    "I dunno, maybe...2/3rds Luke?",

    "We're harder to get rid of than that, Player, you should know that by now.",
    "I think so, Player. At least for now. Rabid Jack's forces have been defeated. Mi-Gor has been decapitated. And you sealed up whatever weird breach was under the Cursed Archipelago. I think we can rest easy for a bit and celebrate with a good drink, or twelve.",
    "Wait! Before we do that, you should clear some inventory space, Player. We've got to properly celebrate your victory with some loot.",
    "Now that Rabid Jack and his minions are dealt with, we can all sit back and relax a bit.",

    "Aye, you've earned it.",
    "Time spent enjoying yourself is never time wasted.",
    "I went down beneath the waves. There were things down there, horrible things swimming in the waters. It makes me shiver just to think about them.",
    "It seems that by mixing the 'rum' with that strange black stone, Mi-Gor could transform people into monsters. Monsters under Rabid Jack's control. By taking over the distillery he was going to ship vast quantities of this serum all across the world. Anyone who drank the 'rum', and there be a lot of sailors who won't look at what they're drinking, would become a monster. We'd get complete chaos as his army would just appear in every major port across the world. If we hadn't stopped him when we did, I'm not sure we would have been able to fight against that.",
    "She took off really as soon as this was all dealt with. Said she had business off in the Eastern Lands. Something odd about the way she carried herself, like she was distant somehow, distracted. Weird thing is, I saw her loading a chest onto her ship before she sailed off. Weird old thing it was. Covered in barnacles and seaweed, as though it had been on the ocean floor for years. Oh well, probably not important."

    "Oh, but you will. When I am free, and I will get free, I will bring my fleet to this region. I will start with the fishing towns, where your defenceless peasants live and I will rain such fire down upon them. Once they are nought but ash, I shall turn on your harbours and your ports. I will cut you off from the rest of the world, so you can never find aid. Finally, I will let your fleets face me directly and I will laugh as I sink them one, by one. And then, when there is only you left, I will allow you to kill yourself and you will thank me for my boundless mercy.",

    "Let's just say that I...dabble, in the occult from time to time. I've got a knack for understanding magical wards and enchantments. It comes in very handy when trying to crack into certain vaults. But now is not the time to discuss my colourful past. You want to find some way to replicate the passcode used to get past that ward.",

    "Really? Where's your discipline? Who's your leader? Do you resolve all your problems via committee?",
    "Ah yes, but how much has it held you back? I command the mightiest pirate fleet to ever sail the oceans of the Eastern Lands. I have scores of loyal pirates who dance to the tune I set. I could take this island from you all in a heartbeat. If I wanted it...I'm not sure I could stomach the smell.",

    "What in the Hell-of-Being-Flayed-By-Knives is that thing?",
    "So, did you learn what you needed to learn from our strange decomposing head here?",
    "One of my ships can take us there. I've got a rowboat anchored at the south-west beach. Prepare for a fight and head there when you are ready.",
    "This Kraken Tooth Island sounds dangerous. You'd best prepare for a fight. When you are ready, use the rowboat I've moored on the south-west beach of Mos Le'Harmless to row out to my ship. I shall ferry you all there.",
    "Do not take that tone with me on my own ship, Bill Teach. We must have hit a coral reef. Make yourselves useful.",
    "Please, Player, if you could check below decks for any damage...",
    "Have you checked below decks yet? We could be sinking! Use the deck door towards the rear of the boat.",

If you're ever in the Eastern Lands, you'll have to look me up. I'm sure we'll have a good many adventures to discuss. But enough chit chat, let's get out of here.",
    "Somewhere ancient. Somewhere long forgotten and with good reason I shouldn't wonder.",
    "I am not sure. I sensed tremendous power, but there was a wrongness to it. Like touching fire and it being cold. Whatever it is, it seemed Jack sealed it away with him. Praise the gods for small mercies.",
    "Oh, no doubt. I'm sure it's just a temporary fix, something like that won't be so easily kept at bay.",
    "Oh, I doubt it. He's gone for now, that much is certain. But I don't even think he can die anymore. No, I'm afraid we likely have not seen the last of him.",

    "There aren't any kittens, Player. I think you've had too much 'rum'.",

    "Like I said, you abandoned him, but gave him a taste of the adventuring lifestyle. He agrees that he and I should become adventurers ourselves, together. We would make an unstoppable duo!",
    "A FABULOUS, albeit slowly decomposing, head.",
    "Indeed. No one would expect us. We would face all our foes with the greatest weapon of all!",
    "The element of SURPRISE! No one expects a zombie head and a rat to defeat them. By the time they realise we're upon them, their fate will already be sealed.",
    "We're...er..still working on that. Arr, but before we can begin to conceive of such a partnership, we must first make sure none can claim Wilson here as mere vermin. He must be clearly displayed as my faithful animal companion. We will need two leather pieces and a gold bar. None of this hard leather, nor any of that scaly stuff. It needs to be plain old normal leather so it doesn't scratch his little neck.",
    "Because every good pet needs a collar. What if he gets lost?",
    "That seems awfully convenient...",

    "I be of the sea, matey. I swam with my fair share of cetaceans.",
    "Bah! What would be the point? The sea is a cruel mistress, she'd claim it soon as we build it. No, I need something more cultural. Something pure. Something that makes a lasting memory. I NEED COCKTAILS! They're cultural, they're pure and they give you long-lasting memories!",
    "I want something with vodka, gin and brandy. I think they'd go well together. I like citrus flavours as well. I'd like it to have that. Finally, it should have a faint leafy flavour to it. Yeah, that should do it.",
    "What can I say? It's what I crave!",
    "Marvellous! Hand it over, matey!",
    "Ahhh. Delicious... Hrmm... No... No. Doesn't quite hit the mark. I think I need something else.",
    "I want something alcoholic. With berries and a sweet, sticky taste. Oooh, and I want it to be creamy. Deliciously creamy, like a cake in liquid form.",
    "That's convenient.",
    "Suit yourself.",
    "Sounds marvellous! Let me try it!",
    "Ooh, yes, that hits the spot. And yet...",
    "Yes, yes. The cream is nice, but I want something sweeter and yet a tinge of bitterness.",
    "I'm tired of gin, I want something with a woodier flavour. Keep it creamy. I love the creamy flavour of these cocktails, but I want a touch of sweetness as well.",
    "Of course you have...",
    "Suit yourself.",
    "Sounds marvellous! Let me try it!",
    "Ahhh, yes, that hit the spot. That's just what I needed.",
    "Nothing left to do but to stare out across the sea and watch the sunset.",
    "It's really quite beautiful, isn't it? The sunset?",
    "When you're sailing out across the great seas - plundering, murdering and all that - you never really stop to appreciate it. The colours as they dance across the waves. The sounds as they change. The night animals taking over from the day. There's a special sort of magic there.",

    "Really? But it's so peaceful and beautiful!",

As I fell into the dark embrace of the ocean, her cold clammy hands clasping round my lungs. I swore revenge and the sea, she answered my prayer. Haha! She changed me she did, the sea. Took my frailty and human weaknesses and gave me life anew. And oh, how I harboured that hate. Oh, how I grew fat upon it. Seething in the ocean depths, and preparing. All for today! Witness, my pathetic brethren! Witness as I reclaim what is rightfully mine! I am Rabid Jack and everything you own belongs TO ME! Pray to your gods if you like. Not that it matters you understand.

    "He wants me ter leave? With what? He sent me ship 'n' crew off ter assault Mos Le'Harmless. An' I ain't swimmin'! Ye tell that sawbones if he wants me ter leave he can call back me ship!",
    "Yeah, well, I don't want to see him! You can go tell him that I want me ship 'n' crew back, and that I wish he and that Murphy fella would circle the drain! He'll know what I mean.",
    "Actually, don't bother. I wanna tell him right to his ugly mask! Hey, barrelchest! Step aside, ye swabbie cur, I want a word with yer boss!",
    "'How appropriate. You fight like a zombie sea cow.'",
    "Felt good gettin' that off me chest.",
    "Worth it!",
    "Fine, seeing I can't tell 'im meself. Just make sure ye include the contempt in me voice when ye tell him.",
    "That ye'd willingly mutiny against that mini mouth-breather and his pet grease zombie would bring a smile ter me face, aye... But I'd not willingly take a backstabber fer me own crew - can't be trusted.",
    "Witchwood? That's an ingredient in the 'rum'? Blimey.",
    "It's not that, just witchwood is really hard to come by is all. Certainly ain't none of this here island. Anyone with half a brain would know how scarce it is, and oh my gosh, he means Luke, doesn't he? If that jumped-up little necrosurgeon thinks I'm gonna chop up me own crew for his experiments...",
    "Fine! If those're me orders, then fine, but doesn't expect me ter be liking 'em. Ye wait here.",
    "Ye'll need to make space before I can give ye anything.",
    "There ye go - yer witchwood. Luke's taking a break from guarding the gate.",
    "Yer not getting any more outta Luke!",
    "Urgh, he sent you out here to order me to keep doing nothing? And here's me thinkin' I couldn't dislike that surgeon sycophant any more than I already did.",
    "I've had enough of you barrelchests. If Mi-Gor's got more orders fer me, he can deliver 'em himself.",

    "Oh, thank goodness! Are you here to help? I need help.",
    "We were doing fine when it was just Captain Donnie - we were able to produce enough 'rum' to keep his crew, er, happy.",
    "But then these two other zombie pirates showed up with these monstrous barrel-chested constructs. At first, it seemed like a good thing. They sent Donnie's ship and crew off somewhere, things quieted down a bit. That is until they stormed the distillery! They took the brewers hostage and are interrogating Captain Braindeath. It was just dumb luck that I was in here at the time. I hid to avoid capture.",
    "That's just it, I don't know! Maybe you can sneak to the side window of the office and listen in?",
    "Oh no, we have to stop them!",
    "Well, that's not right. We don't use witchwood in the recipe. Unless he was giving you a clue... Of course! He was referring to Operation Witchwood! That might just be crazy enough to work!",
    "First off, you'll need to make room for this disguise I made...",
    "First off, you'll probably need this... I've been sneaking about for parts to build a makeshift disguise. Figured it'd come in handy.",
    "It's a plan the Captain and I hatched to get rid of Donnie and his crew. It's named that because we need to get past 50% Luke, but he won't let us. Recently, we've having issues with 'rum'-pumped crabs escaping from the dungeon on the north of the island. They don't often come out of the dungeon, but when they do, they're drawn to our vats of 'rum'. We figured If we could find a way to lure a load of them out, they'd be attraced to Donnie's 'rum'-soaked reprobates and we'd have an army of crabs on our side to chase them off.",
    "You'll also need to figure out how to soak the pirates in the distillery with 'rum', oh, and also how to blow up the dungeon entrance.",
    "Tell you what - if you can find a way to get past 50% Luke, come back here and we'll discuss the finer points of the plan if you need to.",
    "Looking good! That should be enough to fool the guards at least.",
    "66.6...% Luke? You know what, never mind.",
    "You'll still need to gain entry to the distillery somehow. That disguise I gave you should help with that.",
    "Once inside the distillery, you'll need to figure out a way to soak the pirates inside with 'rum', but not Captain Braindeath if you can help it.",
    "Finally, you'll need to head to the north of the island and find a way to blow the dungeon entrance.",
    "You should search the north island to see if there's anything to help you with that...",
    "Good job there's a distillery full of 'rum', then. That stuff is strong enough to blow the doors of a dungeon. If you can nab some barrels from the brewery, I'm sure your friend could make use of them. There'll be some small barrels stored on the upper floor.",
    "Fantastic! Everything is in place. Head to this Baron friend of yours and let's do this thing!",
    "Ello again guv/miss. I take it you're here about the wrench?",
    "Well guv/miss, maybe thats[sic] what I want you to think.",
