    "Bill, I have to ask you something about Rabid Jack.",
    "I'll say it all I like, until I get an explanation as to who he is.",
    "Oh, come on! So far, I've run into his lackeys twice, and I get the feeling he'll keep coming back until I stop him! Can't you see that telling me might save lives?",
    "Who can I ask, then?",
    "Killed him? Can't you just tell me what I want to know?",
    "Great. Well, will this Young Ralph be able to tell me what I need to know?",
    "And is his location a secret too?",
    "Great! So, when are visiting hours?",
    "That's what they think! I have to get to the bottom of this, and if getting locked up is the only way to do it, then so be it.",
    "Thanks. I'm sure, with my acting skills, I'll be able to get arrested in no time.",
    "See! It'll be a doddle.",
    "So, can you at least hint at what is going on?",
    "Excuse me.",
    "I'm a mighty pirate.",
    "...and I've come to be arrested.",
    "That's me!",
    "Well, I am.",
    "I am! Arr! Shiver the mainsails! Splice the gunwalls, cap'n!",
    "Awww. I'd best get dressed up like a pirate, so he believes me next time.",
    "Well, of course!",
    "Heard about it? I was there!",
    "Is this a trick? That ship was sunk!",
    "That's one of your ships!",
    "Yes, that's right, I served on her.",
    "That's what I keep telling you!",
    "Great!",
    "Errr. Great blistering barracudas! I've been caught.",
    "Don't try and fool me...she sank.",
    "I'm a reaving corsair.",
    "I'm a plundering scallywag.",
    "Heard about it? I was there!",
    "Curses. There has to be something around here I can use to outsmart him.",
    "Is this a trick? That ship was sunk!",
    "Not likely, I served on that fine pirate vessel.",
    "That's what I keep telling you!",
    "Great!",
    "Errr. Great blistering barracudas! I've been caught.",
    "She gave a good account against your Customs tub.",
    "Curses. There has to be something around here I can use to outsmart him.",
    "That's one of your ships!",
    "Curses. There has to be something around here I can use to outsmart him.",
    "Okay, okay, I'll store everything.",
    "That's the last of it.",
    "This one here?",
    "Err, alright.",
    "Who, me?",
    "Err, yes?",
    "Hey, you!",
    "Hey! Can't you hear me?",
    "Look, are you Young Ralph? I need to talk to you.",
    "Deaf? How am I supposed to make him turn around? I'll have to find some way to make him look over at me. I'm sure my natural ingenuity will help me to make something out of the things at hand.",
    "I still need to find a way to attract his attention. Come on [Player], time to break out the old ingenuity.",
    "Hmm, I wonder if I can get some writing implements from the guard. At the very least I can get the items necessary to draw up some plans. Guard!",
    "I want to write out a confession.",
    "Yes, the mighty walls of this bastion are so escape-proof that I'd have no means to leave otherwise.",
    "No, I'll not confess! I'll die first.",
    "I suppose I should write something.",
    "You'll not get anything from me!",
    "I don't think there is anything else I can add to this.",
    "Here is my confession.",
    "That's what she said!",
    "Guard! I need more paper.",
    "I think there is a prisoner in a lower cell trying to communicate with me. Now, I'm no expert on codes, but I'll give this a try.",
    "I wonder if they understood.",
    "Err, looks like my rudimentary tapping skills might have caused a faux-pas!",
    "A piece of pipe would come in very handy, if I think about it.",
    "I can't get this open.",
    "Really?",
    "Hey, guard! I'm hungry.",
    "Hey, guard! Give me some of that stew.",
    "I demand stew! Give me some food! This is cruel and unusual punishment.",
    "Gah! That's hot!",
    "I wonder what I can do with this.",
    "I think I've got everything I need from that heap for now.",
    "Seagulls are noisy birds. I wonder if I could use it to disrupt the guard's picnic.",
    "I'd better not attract the guards, or they will see how I used the shirt to lure the seagull.",
    "I'm sure that rehearsing what I wrote on the note has some value but, since Ralph is deaf, I have no need to say it out loud. And why am I talking to this seagull?",
    "I'm sure that this sticky paper will come in handy. I wonder if there is anything I can use this bottle for.",
    "Hmmmm. The glass of this bottle is pretty think around the bottom, I wonder...",
    "You know, I could fight my way to freedom with this broken bottle, or try something else. Something less stupid.",
    "While it ruins the instrument, I'm sure I can find a use for it.",
    "Hmmm, it doesn't seem to quite fit properly.",
    "Well, now I've made this, I can use it to...um... do something?",
    "Steady...",
    "Gotcha!",
    "Well, now that I have this seagull in a tube, I can use it to attract Young Ralph's attention.",
    "I love it when a plan comes together.",
    "Can you hear me?",
    "What was that? I can't hear you.",
    "How did you hear that, then?",
    "So long as you can understand me.",
    "Okay, okay.",
    "(Yes! I've been sent to find you. I have to ask you about... Rabid Jack.)",
    "(You have to help me, Ralph! I have to know who he is, and Bill Teach told me you were the only person that could help.)",
    "(The what?)",
    "(No, all they did was tell me to come see you.)",
    "(And who were they?)",
    "(I'm sorry, but Hector is dead.)",
    "(Yes, he is.)",
    "(I've come such a long way. Will you not give me a hint as to who he is?)",
    "(Right. Well, I'll get these marks and come right back.)",
    "(Not yet.)",
    "I've been to see Young Ralph, and now I need your mark.",
    "What?",
    "Okay, what do you want me to do?",
    "Well, thanks.",
    "Is that it?",
    "I suppose so.",
    "What is it?",
    "Not too good. I have not spoken to Mufassah yet.",
    "Well, how am I supposed to find a pirate with a gimpy leg? That's a terrifying needle-haystack scenario.",
    "Well, that will make it easier to track him down.",
    "Are you 50 Ships Mufassah?",
    "I'm not here to mock you. I merely wanted to meet the man who owns the Idol of Many Heads. It's a real honour!",
    "Yeah! I mean, you are him, aren't you?",
    "Wow! I'd love to see this idol of yours.",
    "Yes! Where do I sign up?",
    "Huzzah! Now, about that idol.",
    "What do you mean?",
    "What?",
    "Sorry, Captain, I have to go ash my hair.",
    "No, thanks.",
    "Sorry, but I can't scrub anything for you.",
    "My entire family was wiped out by a bloodthirsty pack of scrubbing brush-themed bandits. I can't even look at a scrubbing brush without having terrible flashbacks. The bristles! The bristles!",
    "I can't.",
    "My entire ADOPTED family was sucked into a bilge pump and killed.",
    "It's true! It was a very big, very lethal bilge pump.",
    "Would I lie to you?",
    "I know where the Idol of Many Heads is!",
    "Right here in my hands!",
    "Thanks, Bill. I appreciate that.",
    "Sorry, I have a swab allergy.",
    "Hey! I work hard. It's not my fault you happen to keep assigning me tasks I can't complete on medical and/or emotional grounds.",
    "I have cannonio-loadio-phobia.",
    "I faint if I see needles.",
    "With my bad back?",
    "My doctor says I can't, after the last time.",
    "My kitten was killed by a giant rabid mess when I was a child, you monster!",
    "I have too many things to do.",
    "Hey! You asked me to join and I joined. If you had a nice, easy, well-paying job I could do.",
    "I'm sure I will. I'd best tighten my laces now to prevent excess boot-trembling.",
    "Harry, I have a letter of introduction from Bill Teach.",
    "I need to get your mark.",
    "I'm not sure what you heard, but I am confident that Rabid Jack is behind it.",
    "Okay, I'm sorry!",
    "Well, I am pretty good at Smithing. Why do you ask?",
    "Here is the hand, Harry.",
    "Here is the mark I made, Harry.",
    "Thank you.",
    "No, I'm here about Rabid Jack.",
    "I've come for your mark to take to Young Ralph. Will you let me have it?",
    "Great!",
    "Oh, for crying out loud!",
    "I'm sorry. It's just that this is a lot of effort when all I'm trying to do is help.",
    "That doesn't sound too hard.",
    "Great.",
    "Err, sure.",
    "Not just yet.",
    "Okay, I'll just flat-out ask for some 'rum'. That might make him think there's a demand for it.",
    "I'll have a shot of Braindeath's finest 'rum' please!",
    "Err. I'll have a shot of Braindeath's finest 'rum', please? Although, I'd settle for you not looking at me like you're going to kill me.",
    "No! I just like the stuff. Honestly!",
    "Well, yeah.",
    "That's dashed inconvenient. Could you order some in for me?",
    "Oh, alright.",
    "How many people would need to ask?",
    "Oh, really...",
    "Excuse me, sir. Do you have any Braindeath 'rum' today?",
    "Drat!",
    "I suppose I should take this off before I try to trick him again. Oh, well.",
    "I'll have a drink \u2013 and you have one too!",
    "Excuse me, sir. Do you have any Braindeath 'rum' today?",
    "I'll have a drink... and you have one too!",
    "I'll have a drink... and you have one too!",
    "I'll have a drink... and you have one too!",
    "I'll have a drink... and you have one too!",
    "I'll have a drink... and you have one too!",
    "I'll have a drink... and you have one too!",
    "Oh, okay. Well, you stay right there until you feel better.",
    "'Ello, guvn'r, you got ant Braindeath 'rum'?",
    "Cor blimey, that's all sixes and sevens, and no mistake. I'll come back later to see if you've got some in, then.",
    "G'day mate. I'm looking fer the old Braindeath 'rum'.",
    "Stone the crows! I'll have to pop in later to see if you've got any then, mate.",
    "Excuse me, dear sir. Would you be having have any Braindeath 'rum' today?",
    "Well, now you are knowing. I will be coming back later, when you might have some in.",
    "I say, old chap. I feel like a spot of Braindeath 'rum'. Do you have any?",
    "Good show! I'll finish my constitutional and come back to see if you have some later.",
    "Excuse me, sir. Do you have any Braindeath 'rum' today?",
    "Well, now you know better. I'll return later to see if you've stocked up.",
    "Is there enough demand for you to get some in?",
    "I think that's my cue to leave and get changed.",
    "Hey, there. Have you got any-",
    "How do you mean?",
    "Sure, I'll take a note to him.",
    "With such fabulous wealth on offer, you won't see me for dust.",
    "I managed to convince him of the demand, and he made an order for some of your 'rum'.",
    "Here it is.",
    "Thanks. I assure you I'll do everything in my power to solve this mystery, Captain.",
    "It goes well. I'm just getting to the bottom of this mystery.",
    "Really? Which parts are the saddest?",
    "Not really.",
    "Yes.",
    "Err, thanks.",
    "That's okay.",
    "Gulp!",
    "How's things?",
    "Wow! It must have been one of those marketing peaks you hear about.",
    "Oh, okay.",
    "How community-minded of you.",
    "Sorry. Not right now.",
    "It goes well. I've even collected the tiny reward the barman promised for my services.",
    "Now, if only it had been more than 20 gold.",
    "Frank, did Hector ever tell you anything about...Rabid Jack?",
    "I'll take that as a yes. I need to get your mark to take to Young Ralph. Can I have it?",
    "I already told Young Ralph that Hector was dead, and he agreed to take your mark.",
    "What?",
    "More proof! He ordered the attack on Harmony Monastery! Wait a second... If I get you a letter from the head of the terrorised monks, would that be enough?",
    "Okay, wait right here.",
    "I'll have it for you in a moment.",
    "Brother Tranquility! I have a favour to ask.",
    "I need you to write a letter to a friend about what happened. You see, I am going to find out who this Rabid Jack person is and they need more proof that he was behind it.",
    "What?",
    "No, of course not. I just hope that will be enough proof for him.",
    "Thanks.",
    "I still have to deliver it. Fingers crossed!",
    "Frank! Here's the letter.",
    "I hate those buts and I cannot lie...",
    "Well, what sort of proof do you want? I mean, this person seems to have left very few traces. Only me, Tranquility and Captain Donnie- Wait a sec, a plan occurs to me! How about this: if I were to get you proof from one of his captains, would that work?",
    "Right, I'll be aback with proof in a moment.",
    "I have a cunning plan involving a pirate costume, a drunken zombie and a side order of sneaky shenanigans!",
    "Arr, Cap'n! I'm here to review the orders.",
    "I guess I'll have to dress a little more like a pirate.",
    "Aye, Cap'n. Just fished me out of the ocean, so they did. Yes, I'm going to need to see the orders so I can help out and pull my weight.",
    "Thanks Cap. But the bottom half \u2013 I can't read this.",
    "I can't take this to Frank. You didn't make a copy of these, did you?",
    "Not much of one?",
    "That will do. Wait, how do you accidentally carve several lines of text into someone's leg?",
    "On that note, I leave.",
    "What?",
    "How dare you suggest such a thing!",
    "I was going to blow my nose on it. I have allergies.",
    "It's for a skin condition.",
    "Well, for your information, Mr. Smarty-peg, I happen to have a skin condition that needs charcoal to treat \u2013 one that I'm very sensitive about. It's called Hydro...endo...cardio...spatula...it is...syndrome.",
    "Yes! So, here I was, lamenting my allergies and hoping to find someplace private to apply my charcoal, and I HAPPEN to trip over. As there was nothing to steady myself on, both my hands HAPPENED to grab your leg...in a rubbing motion. CLEARLY I should have just hurled myself to the ground rather than support myself, eh?",
    "Oh, don't you 'sorry' me! Good day to you, sir!",
    "Arr, Cap'n!",
    "Will these plans do, Frank?",
    "Thanks. I am getting the feeling I will need it.",
    "Oh come on! I'm sure he can't measure up to some of the things I've faced.",
    "I'm going to need to get training.",
    "Izzy. I was wondering if I could have your mark.",
    "Yes, I need to speak to Young Ralph.",
    "I don't know what's going on, but I think Rabid Jack is behind it.",
    "This is very important!",
    "Yes, that's how I learned about the marks.",
    "That's how you're talking to me now.",
    "Okay. I'll be back as soon as I can.",
    "I still have to get the brooch back.",
    "With awesome daring and courage.",
    "Okay, okay, keep your cap on!",
    "Hello in there! I'm here to get some evidence.",
    "Hello there.",
    "I need the personal effects of Wanda the Fish.",
    "Oh, I seem to have forgotten it.",
    "Here it is.",
    "I think this is the right file. [Same answer for all]",
    "I already have a file. I don't need another.",
    "Izzy, I have the brooch.",
    "Not a problem. I just hope I can get to the bottom of this soon.",
    "How are you holding up, Izzy?",
    "No problem. Glad to help.",
    "With awesome daring and courage. Say, do you have a folder or something? I wrote out a confession and have evidence of the many, many crimes that I think your superiors will want to see.",
    "Here you go.",
    "Sure, let's get going.",
    "(Yes, sort of.)",
    "(I have smuggled them onto the island, but they are up in the locker room. I'll be back with them shortly.)",
    "Can I get the file on [Player], please?",
    "Nice day, isn't it?",
    "Do you?",
    "(Here they are.)",
    "You did what?",
    "Wow. Where were you?",
    "But now he's back.",
    "(Do you want me to help you to escape?).",
    "(That does make sense. I suppose I'll come by to visit you when I can, Ralph.)",
    "Thanks Bill!",
    "Now that I know what this is all about, what should I do?",
    "I can't accept that. He could cause some real trouble next time.",
    "How are things, Harry?",
    "I'm sure, once I know what is going on, I'll be able to sort things out.",
    "Thanks!",
    "What?",
    "This parrot is dead!",
    "Look, this parrot is dead. I'm not going to get dragged into some pantomime over its being asleep, or something.",
    "What do you mean by that?",
    "Tell me!",
    "How upset?",
    "I think I saw it move! Good polly. Pretty bird.",
    "So, where is Achmed now?",
    "Just fine, thanks.",
    "Hiya! I'm just taking polly for a walk.",
    "No it isn't. If it was dead, then Achmed the Brutally Violent would get 'upset', and that would never do.",
    "Nothing you need to concern yourself with.",
    "Yet."

    "Quiet there, [lad/lass]! Don't say that sea-devil's name.",
    "Yer a hard one alright, [Player], but you'll not get that story out of me.",
    "Aye, that I can, but 'tis not my place to tell ye.",
    "The man that killed him \u2013 Young Ralph.",
    "I want te [lad/lass], but we all- we all swore an oath not te tell anyone about This Albatross and That Butcher.",
    "Aye, he will. But ye'll have te get te him first.",
    "No, no! He's had himself locked up protective-like in the Customs and Excise prison! 'Tis the big rock off the coast of Karamja. Ye can't miss it, even with a two-cannon broadside.",
    "Quarter-past never, 'til half-past sometime. The only way to get into prison is fer piracy, and there ain't no way back.",
    "Aye [lad/lass], these be strange times, and I wish ye luck. Yer best bet is te go te the Office in Rimmington and see if ye can get yerself arrested there.",
    "Yer performance as a pirate is pretty criminal, I'll allow that.",
    "I wish I could, but an oath is an oath. All I can say is yer better off goin' to the Rimmington Customs Office and trying te see Young Ralph there.",
    "Okay [lad/lass], but before I can give it to ye, ye'll need t' do a little errand for me.",
    "'Tis purely symbolic. To give ye my mark, I'll need ye to do a little task. Nothing too serious, mind.",
    "Simple: there is a pirate in port called 50 Ships Mufassah. He's almost as bad a pirate as you.",
    "He's got an idol called the Idol of Many Heads, which is pretty much the only piece of treasure he hasn't lost, buried someplace obvious or sold fer 'rum'. If you bring it back to me, I'll give you my mark.",
    "Aye, that's all. See, nothing t' get worked up over, just a little task to satisfy tradition.",
    "While yer collectin' our marks, ye'll need this.",
    "'Tis a letter of introduction to Brass Hand Harry. He's a little old-fashioned and won't talk to anyone that ain't been vouched fer yet.",
    "How's the treasure-huntin'?",
    "Well he's not too hard te pin down. I hear he's moving slowly since he busted his leg.",
    "He just broke it, ye lummox. He's on crutches!",
    "Fer most people, aye.",
    "Where?",
    "See, nice and simple! Here is my mark, [Player], and I wish ye luck with this little endeavour.",
    "Give up Jack, yer finished.",
    "Jack!",
    "Here, take this. I found it up by yon black rock on the hill. I think it be magical. There was also a dead mole in there, thrashin' around like it were alive. I shook it out and it burrowed away. I never seen anything like it in all my days. I'm sure it'll be worth some money.",
    "Arr, fer all yer runnin' around I thought it'd be a little recompense.",
    "I don't know. I suppose we wait te see what he does next.",
    "Well, I'm sure ye'll come up with somethin'."

He got greedy fer power and booty, and saught te take over Mos le'Harmless with his cronies. He brought his fleet te the port and laid it te siege, only te be repulsed. In his rage he renamed his ship This Albatross, sayin' that it would be a curse upon us all. Then, he and his corsairs sailed the seas, reavin' and plunderin' and burnin' anythin' they couldn't carry. The Customs Office, who we had a bit of an accord with, turned against us and hunted us down like dogs, tarrin' us all with that swine's brush. So, we did the only thing we could do.",
    "We hunted down that mad dog and put him down, [Player]. To the south of Harmony, there is a number of islands we call the Cursed Archipelago. They be filled with wicked magicks and evil spirits, and that dog had taken his fleet and made camp there without them touchin' him. He thought us too afeared to follow, and he was wrong. We caught him at anchor and...",
    "I was on Harry's ship at that point.",
    "I see 'im, 'Arry! I see the dog!",
    "...we had te put the rest of his crew te the sword, and scuttle the ships. They fought like the lash of Jack wer on their backs, even though he was dead and gone. We never found the body, mind, and none that went divin' fer it ever came back to the surface. So, we swore to never speak of the butcher and his black deeds, for if his name were to be a curse te us, we thought it best te forget it and let it rot on the ocean floor with his cursed bones.",

    "Well, regardless, I can't really help you, as I can't sign anything with this hand. I would normally just print my palm on a piece of paper, but Smith is behind on spares and I don't want to ruin this one. How handy are you with a hammer?",
