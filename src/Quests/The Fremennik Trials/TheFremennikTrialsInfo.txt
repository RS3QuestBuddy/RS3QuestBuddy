Talk to Thorvald the Warrior in the helmet store north of the longhall. (Chat 1) In order to receive his vote, you must kill a special warrior called Koschei the deathless.
However...`
The fight has three rules: 
You must defeat him at least three out of four times. 
You must fight to the death, and
You are not allowed to use weapons or armour or beasts of burden- which also means no runes, staves, etc (you can use food, prayer, rings of recoil, already summoned familiars or even a dismantled godsword). If you have a pickaxe in your toolbelt you can remove it once inside the basement and use it to fight Koschei.`
Go into the basement to begin the fight. Run in circles from arena to arena in order for him to spawn.`
Koschei has 4 forms, each one more difficult than the last. There is no safe spot to attack him from, although you can trap him over the poles with fire burning on top of them and heal yourself. Don't stay there too long or he'll disappear and reappear after you return to combat, and you'll start over at his first form
Kill him.`

Cook the red herring to get sticky red goop and use it on the wooden disk to get a second red disk. Then go down the other trapdoor and use the two disks on the abstract mural to get a vase lid.`
Go upstairs and set exactly four litres of water on the chest. You need the jug, which can hold 3 units of water and the bucket, which holds 5 units, to open the chest. Here is what you should do:`
From the tap, fill the jug with water, then use the jug on the bucket.`
Do this again and you'll have a full bucket and a 1/3 full jug.`
Use the bucket on the drain to get an empty bucket.`
Fill up the bucket with the 1/3 full jug.`

Use the 4/5ths full bucket with the chest, and it will open, giving you a vase.`
Fill the vase with water to make a vase of water.`
Use the lid on the vase to get a sealed vase.`
Use the sealed vase with the frozen table to freeze the water, which then expands in the vase and shatters it. You will receive a key frozen in a block of ice (if you accidentally freeze the water without sealing it, use it on the range to empty it).`
Thaw the frozen key on the range, then go down the eastern ladder again and out the exit. You will receive Peer the Seer's vote.`
