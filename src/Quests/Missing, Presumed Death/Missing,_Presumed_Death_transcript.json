    "Adventurer, wait! Please... Oh great Saradomin please help me!",
    "It all happened so fast. Please protect me. Please! Oh no - what if they come back?",
    "Someone... murdered my brothers. Th-they left me alive. Why didn't they take me and not them?",
    "But look at them! They didn't deserve an end like that.",
    "I can hardly look at them. It's as if their souls can't pass on to the afterlife...",
    "It only happened after their murder, I-I don't think it was the killer that caused it. They just look so tormented... I keep racking my brains, but it's all a blur. Damn my old age - I can't remember anything of the attacker!  P-please, I beg of you... Help me search for evidence so we can find who killed my brothers and bring them to justice.",
    "Oh thank you, adventurer! I think it would be best to start by searching for clues that point to the killer. You're bound to find something in the surrounding area. Y-you should check th-the... bodies, too. Take my notebook and update it with clues as you find them, I need a moment to collect my thoughts...",
    "They may have died fast, but look at them now. It's as if their souls can't pass on to the afterlife...",
    "It only happened after their murder. I-I don't think it was the killer that caused it. They just look so tormented...: I keep racking my brains, but it's all a blur. Damn my old age - I can't remember anything of the attacker! P-please, I beg of you ... Help me search for evidence so we can find who killed my brothers and bring them to justice.",
    "They were monks, not fighters. Pacifists! But it's as if their souls can't pass on to the afterlife.",
    "It only happened after their murder. I-I don't think it was the killer that caused it. They just look so tormented... I keep racking my brains, but it's all a blur. Damn my old age - I can't remember anything of the attacker! P-please, I beg of you ... Help me search for evidence so we can find who killed my brothers and bring them to justice.",
    "You also follow the god of order? Oh, praise him! He has not forsaken me yet. Someone... murdered my brothers. Th-they left me alive. Why didn't they take me and not them?",
    "Saradomin bless you, adventurer. Let me take a look at what you've found. Strange. Most peculiar. It could have been an elf who did this, the ring and arrow seem to be elven craft. I just can't remember, it was all over so quickly...",
    "I'm sorry. I have seen much in my many years but I never thought to stare evil in the face as today. Let me think. My only knowledge of the elves comes from tales and legends I was told as a child. My mother used to read from time to time. I vaguely remember the tale of their goddess, Seren. She was ridden with guilt, and shattered herself into thousands of crystals to always be with her followers. But she was supposed to believe the different races could live in peace. Why would an elf want to do this to us?",
    "No, I- I don't think so. Although I did notice a strange man when we passed some stone steps to the west - very strange indeed! He was carrying a sack of bones and muttering to himself. Perhaps you should find out if he saw anything.",
    "Did he have any useful information?",
    "Just as we suspected! That elf must have been involved somehow. Did he mention anything else?",
    "Oh, I'm not sure if that fits. I must say, I haven't met many elves in my time. Was there any more?",
    "A man living up there with only bones for company? He probably doesn't get many visitors.",
    "I-I'm not sure I can draw a conclusion. Perhaps I'm still in shock... Who do you think it was?",
    "I would say the same, but I'm not sure the odd man's description of the killer matches. Besides, I can't see a motive. And it's strange they would discard their precious crystals.",
    "I suppose the crystals point to Seren, but how? She could have had some involvement but I really can't imagine she was the killer.",
    "Me? How could you even suggest such a thing? I would never do anything to hurt my brothers.",
    "Still, I can see your suspicions... I must assure you adventurer, I had no hand in this brutality.",
    "He may act suspiciously but none of the evidence points towards him. Living in the area and talking to a sack of bones does not make him guilty.",
    "Zamorak. I shudder at the name. It is true that he would wish harm upon Saradomin's followers. But none of the clues point towards him. We need to find the killer using the evidence we've found.",
    "Sliske? The name is unfamiliar to me. Perhaps you know something I do not, adventurer.",
    "Zamorakians? In Paterdomus? I must inform King Roald of this... desecration! I'm sorry, adventurer. I must focus on the task at hand... While I am outraged that they have seen fit to take over our temple, I don't believe the evidence points towards the Zamorakian monks.",
    "Perhaps you're right. It would be unwise to rush this and jump to a conclusion.",
    "Did the odd man mention what direction the figure was heading?",
    "If they left crystals behind maybe you could pick up some sort of trail and figure out where they went?",
    "You should take the same approach as before, note down any clues and try to find a witness.",
    "What? Who in Saradomin's name would do such a thing? You- You don't think someone was...",
    "Maybe they were protecting us - avenging Saradomin's loyal followers!",
    "Okay, let me take a look.",
    "The evidence you've found seems to suggest the killing has something to do with Saradomin. How could somebody do this?",
    "Could it be other monks? Wizards? There is no feud between Seren and Saradomin that I know of...",
    "All this mindless killing just doesn't make any sense to me.",
    "A cruel place indeed. I don't know what I'll do without my brothers... We have to find this criminal.",
    "You're right. If we put our minds to it, I'm sure we can figure this out!",
    "I... I guess you're right. I can grieve when this is all over.",
    "Did you manage to find any witnesses?",
    "Really? What did he see? He must have had some useful information.",
    "Vanished? P-perhaps a teleport spell. How are we supposed to find them now?",
    "I haven't heard of anything like that before. It doesn't sound like any normal teleport spell.",
    "We seem to have found all the evidence but have no clear explanation.",
    "I am no expert on magic and I know little of elves or wizards. I think it's time we sought help, adventurer.",
    "I have an old friend who also worships Saradomin. We were close friends when we were younger. But I became a monk, and she a wizard.",
    "Her name is Valina and she specializes in crystal magic. You should go and talk to her to see what she knows about the clues.",
    "You can find her at the entrance to the Wizards' tower, south of Draynor village.",
    "I knew I could count on her. This information changes things somewhat.",
    "Elves, monks, wizards, gods, this is all so confusing! What do you think is going on?",
    "I must agree, there is something sinister afoot here. Who do you think committed this atrocity then?",
    "Hmm. You seem clearer than I in my old age. Who do you think committed this atrocity then?",
    "I'm sorry. My mind is frail and old, if only I could remember. Who do you think could have committed this atrocity?",
    "Initially the clues did seem to point that way, but the information from Valina seems to absolve them.",
    "Perhaps someone was trying to frame a Saradominist wizard.",
    "Saradomin? The thought may have crossed my mind, but it seems like madness.",
    "He is the god of order and wisdom. He would never do something like this, even in defense of his followers!",
    "Me? How could... I'm offended you would accuse me after I begged for your help! These monks were my friends!",
    "I suppose I can forgive your suspicions though, adventurer.",
    "He may have been in the area, but there is no evidence to suggest he had a hand in this.",
    "He's a pyromaniac, not a killer. His job ensures the safety of many people.",
    "Valina? How Dare y-I mean... I've known Valina for many years. She isn't capable of something like this.",
    "Besides, she helped us out of the kindness of her heart. I can't even imagine it was her.",
    "Sliske? As I'm not familiar with him I cannot rule him out. Perhaps you've seen something I've missed, adventurer.",
    "King Tyras? As I'm not familiar with him I cannot rule him out. Perhaps you've seen something I've missed, adventurer.",
    "I may not be as sharp as I used to be, but I am tough to fool, adventurer.",
    "The crime scenes are so similar. It's almost as if the clues were planted.",
    "Precisely! And besides, Seren and Saradomin have no quarrel with each other. I.. I think someone might be trying to turn them against each other!",
    "Ahh! What?",
    "Who said what? I can't hear anything.",
    "What do you mean? I can't hear anything.",
    "Wait. Can you feel that rumbling?",
    "I-Uhh, excuse me... Wh-who is this Sliske?",
    "I can't believe it... You were right all along, adventurer. We have to bring him to justice!",
    "B-but... Sorry, but he killed my brothers.",
    "By the light of Saradomin... It's the God of the Underworld, Icthlarin!",
    "W-wait... Did you bring Sliske to justice?",
    "B-but, what about my brothers? He's a murderer...",
    "What a day!",
    "Thank you for all your help. I am eternally grateful adventurer.",
    "Take these as thanks, they are the least I can offer."

  "Player": [
    "What's going on?",
    "It's okay, I can help you.",
    "It sounds like you're lucky to be alive.",
    "Something's happening to their bodies.",
    "How did that happen to them?",
    "It seems like they had a quick death.",
    "How did that happen to them?",
    "Doesn't look like they put up much of a fight.",
    "How did that happen to them?",
    "You have to try and calm down.",
    "Pull yourself together, old man.",
    "Saradomin has led me to your aid. (if aligned with Saradomin)",
    "I've thoroughly searched the area, I think I have all the clues now.",
    "It must be horrible, but try to focus.",
    "I encountered the elves when I travelled to Tirannwn. From what I learned, the clues do seem to point towards them. (conditions unknown)",
    "Are you sure there weren't any witnesses?",
    "That sounds like a good idea.",
    "Come on, you must remember!",
    "Stop feeling sorry for yourself.",
    "I'm conducting an investigation. Have you seen anything out of the ordinary recently?",
    "A group of monks were murdered nearby, I'm trying to get to the bottom of it.",
    "Please, I could really use your help. If you'll just answer a few questions then I'll be on my way.",
    "Have you seen any elves?",
    "I don't have time for you lies. Tell me what you've seen or this won't end well for you.",
    "I found a lot of evidence at the crime scene that points towards an elf. I just need a little more information, please.",
    "I knew it! This can't be a coincidence. What did you hear?",
    "I'm the one asking questions. You'd better answer them before I lose my patience.",
    "Earlier you said you hear a lot of things too. What kind of things?",
    "Don't play dumb with me - you said you hear things. I'll give you 3 seconds before I draw my weapon. 3...",
    "Was it the elf you saw earlier?",
    "That's interesting. Thanks for your help.",
    "I spoke to the old man. You were right. He was strange.",
    "He saw an elf heading east along the path.",
    "He saw a very tall, dark, hooded figure escaping.",
    "He wasn't very cooperative.",
    "An elf.",
    "The elf god, Seren.",
    "Brother Samwell.",
    "Odd Old Man.",
    "The chaos god, Zamorak.",
    "Sliske (Unlocked by The World Wakes).",
    "Zamorakian monks (Unlocked by Legacy of Seergaze).",
    "I think somebody else did this.",
    "According to him, the killer made off to the east.",
    "Good idea. I'll see what I can find.",
    "I'm investigating a murder and was wondering if you could answer some questions.",
    "This is much more important than your stupid beacon, answer my questions or things will get ugly.",
    "I need to know if you've seen anything out of the ordinary recently?",
    "I've had enough of this. If you don't start talking, I'll make a glorious fire out of you!",
    "What happened? Any information could help me find the killer and stop them from coming back here.",
    "Did you get a look at who the attacker was?",
    "Okay, thanks for the help. This information will be really useful.",
    "I found an elf like the clues suggested, but... She had been murdered. Saradomin's symbol had been branded into the palms of her hands.",
    "I've searched thoroughly. I think I have all the clues.",
    "I spoke to the beacon tender who was nearby when the elf was killed. He was able to see from a nearby hilltop.",
    "He said the killer vanished into thin air.",
    "I'm not sure. Blaze said that when the killer vanished, all the light was sucked out of the area. What could that mean?",
    "Whom do you have in mind?",
    "I was told by brother Samwell that you might be able to help us.",
    "Not so great actually. A group of monks he was travelling with was attacked. He's okay, but we're trying to find the culprit.",
    "He's a little shaken, but he'll be fine. I just need some information so I can track down the killer.",
    "Some of the victims were killed by similar stab wounds. Here - it would be easier if you had a look at my notes.",
    "I spoke to Wizard Valina and noted down what she told me.",
    "It does seem odd for an assassin to leave so many clues.",
    "None of this seems to explain the trapped souls.",
    "Ahhhh!",
    "Who said that?",
    "I think I'm hearing things.",
    "Icthlarin? Is that you?",
    "An intrepid adventurer.",
    "A mighty warrior.",
    "A shrewd investigator.",
    "A courageous hero.",
    "<playername>, courageous hero.",
    "Why should I tell you?",
    "Someone killed these people.",
    "I'm not quite sure.",
    "What's happened to Death?",
    "I believe the clues indicate Sliske, a devious and unpredictable Mahjarrat.",
    "What is a Mahjarrat?",
    "Why is he committing these crimes?",
    "One of them was carrying this box.",
    "Sliske's ascension?",
    "And what if I was to open it?",
    "We should attend his ascension.",
    "We shouldn't trust him.",
    "What do you mean?",
    "But why plant the clues at the crime scenes?",
    "But if we don't save Death, will things ever go back to normal?",
    "No, I need some time to think about this.",
    "I want to continue to the citadel.",
    "I want to see if I can learn anything interesting.",
    "What are you going to do about the threat Amascut poses?",
    "Who is Armadyl?",
    "Who are you?",
    "Has Armadyl returned?",
    "Does Kree'arra remember our fight? (Unlocked by The World Wakes)",
    "Is this Sliske's citadel?",
    "Goodbye",
    "Why are you here?",
    "What will you do if their argument escalates here?",
    "What have you been doing?",
    "How are you finding your new form?",
    "Goodbye.",
    "Why aren't you trying to fight everyone?",
    "Bandos is here?",
    "Who's Bandos?",
    "Why aren't you trying to fight everyone?",
    "Bandos is here?",
    "Who's Bandos?",
    "Why does he care so much?",
    "Why are you Zarosians here?",
    "Did Sliske invite you?",
    "Is Sliske still Zarosian?",
    "Do you believe Sliske has ascended to godhood?",
    "Ask about Senntisten (unlocked by Temple at Senntisten)",
    "How do you know?",
    "Goodbye.",
    "Why are you here?",
    "What's stopping you going in there?",
    "Are you still loyal to Zamorak?",
    "Goodbye.",
    "What's going on?",
    "It was Sliske that murdered them. He planted the clues to set Seren and Saradomin up!",
    "So he could give you false information in order to lure them to his ascension!",
    "I investigated the crime scenes with Icthlarin. Sliske employed similar tactics to lure him here, too.",
    "Saradomin's followers have wronged the elves, Zilyana. You should beg for their forgiveness.",
    "You've wronged Saradomin's followers, Ilfeen. You should beg for their forgiveness.",
    "What are you?",
    "What's this all about?",
    "Stop wasting my time.",
    "I don't trust you.",
    "What do I do?",
    "Why should I take part?",
    "This'll be a piece of cake.",
    "Sounds fun!",
    "Fine, but only to find Death.",
    "You look cleverer than you are. Where's Death?",
    "Tell me where he is.",
    "Get to the point.",
    "What are you doing here?",
    "I don't have time for your ga-",
    "That's more like it, let's hear this riddle...",
    "That's nothing for a mastermind like me!",
    "A stupid riddle for a stupid mask.",
    "I like a challenge.",
    "How can I trust you to free Death?",
    "Can I hear the riddle again?",
    "How do I answer?",
    "Goodbye.",
    "Now hold up your end of the bargain. I played your game - you must release Death.",
    "But what about Death? You said you would free him if I answered your stupid riddle!",
    "I earned my invitation fair and square.",
    "I follow the Empty Lord. You have a lot to answer for, Sliske.",
    "Seren is my goddess. If she can't be here then I'll uphold her teachings in her absence.",
    "I have pledged allegiance to the Godless. I have more right to be here - or in Gielinor for that matter - than any of you.",
    "I've had enough of your games, Sliske. Release Death before things get ugly.",
    "None of us should trust Sliske. I was there - I saw him murder Guthix!",
    "How did you capture a creature as powerful as the dragonkin?",
    "I saw the Staff of Armadyl for myself. How did you get hold of it?",
    "So he brought it right to you?",
    "Sir Tiffy, Thaerisk and I teleported the stone somewhere even we couldn't have known. How has it come into your hands?",
    "Where did you find it?",
    "You brought us here for your ascension. Have you become a god or not?",
    "What?",
    "This is what the world needs. There are too many gods dividing the people of Gielinor.",
    "Don't you see the destruction this will cause? The gods have already done enough damage.",
    "Finally the deserving god will be able to reign above all others.",
    "The day has finally come for me to take my deserved place as a god!",
    "I don't trust you to keep your word Sliske. I won't be fooled.",
    "Armadyl is right. We can all live harmoniously, in peace. We have to bring Sliske to justice.",
    "Bandos is right. It's time the arguing stops and we see who is really the most powerful.",
    "You are all a negative influence on the world. Have your contest somewhere else and leave us mortals out of it.",
    "All your efforts are futile. Soon Zaros will return to reclaim his throne regardless.",
    "Guthix may be gone, but many of us still follow his teachings. We will seek balance, whatever the outcome. I am a Guardian of Guthix. I have supported him at every turn and will continue to uphold his values.",
    "I don't know!",
    "What will you do now?"

    "Well now there's no need to be like that, I think you should leave...",
    "Hmm...",

  "Brother Samwell\u00a0There are many groups that wear blue robes": [

  "Wizard Valina": [
    "Welcome to the Wizards' tower, adventurer.",
    "Oh yes, my dear friend Samwell. It's been years since I saw him. How is he, anyway?",
    "Gosh.. He isn't hurt is he? I'll help in any way I can. I'm afraid I can't leave my post, though.",
    "Oh my, what a mess. It seems you've found some very strange clues, but I think I can help. I have a lot of experience in some of these fields.",
    "I'll help in any way I can.",
    "Well, where do I start. I'm sure you're aware that it's quite uncommon for an elf to venture so far from Tirannwn, but it's not unheard of.",
    "I'm particularly intrigued by the crystals you've found. Being an expert on crystal magics, I have conducted much research on the subject.",
    "Firstly, crystals are extremely precious to the elves. For them to be discarded so carelessly is highly irregular.",
    "And that's ignoring the assumption that a skilled assassin would leave any clues at all.",
    "Secondly, a crystal arrow would be entirely crystalline. I've yet to come across an arrow that is crystal-tipped as you've described.",
    "In summary, the clues you've found are quite misleading. So I would advise caution, adventurer.",
    "Some of these clues do appear to indicate the involvement of a Saradominist, potentially a wizard.",
    "As you can see, my position allows me to keep track of the comings and goings of many wizards. Anyone entering or leaving must check in with me.",
    "No one from this tower has left for a significant amount of time, but admittedly I cannot account for all Saradominist wizards across Gielinor.",
    "Regardless, this kind of behaviour is uncharacteristic for a follower of Saradomin. It seems an unlikely conclusion.",
    "Thank you, adventurer.",
    "Given the clues, you are right to put my counter-argument under scrutiny. Let's look at this logically:",
    "Firstly, the weapon of choice. The elf was killed by an accurate stab wound. Wizards are trained in magic, not combat.",
    "Secondly, we all wear the same standard of robes. You describe the blue fabric at the crime scene as rough linen.",
    "Whereas our robes are woven from wool and imbued with defensive enchantments, which give the fabric a distinctive shine.",
    "If anything, it sounds like the killer was trying to impersonate a wizard.",
    "What on earth are you insinuating? I am an esteemed wizard of Saradomin. I hold honesty and integrity in the utmost regard.",
    "Now if you must scrutinise my counter-argument, I will offer a more scientific hypothesis.",
    "Firstly, the weapon of choice. The elf was killed by an accurate stab wound. Wizards are trained in magic, not combat.",
    "Secondly, we all wear the same standard of robes. You describe the blue fabric at the crime scene as rough linen.",
    "Whereas our robes are woven from wool and imbued with defensive enchantments, which give the fabric a distinctive shine.",
    "If anything, it sounds like the killer was trying to impersonate a wizard.",
    "Ah yes, this doesn't sound like regular teleportation. Normally, the spell would emit light, rather than absorb it.",
    "A possible explanation is that the killer opened a rift to escape to a darker realm or dimension.",
    "But that would require powerful magic, which most wizards have yet to master. It doesn't seem to conform to the other evidence.",
    "It all depends on how reliable you believe this 'Blaze Sharpeye' to be, really.",
    "This may surprise you adventurer, but we have been receiving reports of similar happenings recently.",
    "I must say, I've never encountered anything like this before. An ethereal spirit trapped in the physical world. How intriguing.",
    "Here at the tower we research all manner of magic. I'm not aware of something like this ever being documented until now.",
    "I would say this is not a magical phenomenon, and certainly not related to your killer.",
    "What we're dealing with here is on a much larger scale. It would seem something quite drastic is happening."

    "I sensed many dead here, but I did not foresee these circumstances. What happened?",
    "Our paths cross again, mortal. I sensed there was more to your fate that day in the pyramid.",
    "I sensed many dead here, but I did not foresee these circumstances. What happened?",
    "It would not be wise to question a god. I shall warn you only once.",
    "Perceptive. These mortals passed at the hands of another. Pawns in a greater plan, perhaps.",
    "Indeed, the reason for these mortals' passing is not immediately apparent. Pawns in a greater plan, perhaps.",
    "There has been a most grave turn of events, adventurer. The reaper of souls, whom you know as Death, has gone missing.",
    "Without his scythe, there is nothing to sever the tie between souls and their physical shells.",
    "Look about you. The souls are in limbo, shackled to these lifeless husks.",
    "I have travelled across all of Gielinor bearing witness to the same thing. I cannot help them all.",
    "I am the guardian of souls. I care not for the process of dying, for that is the concern of the reaper.",
    "I stand my vigil at the gates of Gielinor's Underworld. It is a dark place filled with all manner of devourer beasts; their thirst for souls insatiable.",
    "It is there that Death delivers the souls he has collected, so I may safely shepherd them to the afterlife.",
    "Without him, the souls remain trapped. Without me, they become lost.",
    "Death does have fail safes in place: helpers that are able to use shards from his scythe to release souls.",
    "But we are in times of great unrest, and they are unable to keep pace with the flow of souls.",
    "So I am assisting by transporting the deceased to them. But I am tired, mortal - there is much that needs my attention.",
    "I have not known Death to abandon his duty. Not once in thousands of years...",
    "There are sinister powers at work here mortal. I must find him, with due haste. Before things fall apart completely.",
    "You have a keen eye, mortal. I am familiar with this miscreant, I believe he may be connected to Death's disappearance.",
    "The question is: why? Kidnapping Death and attempting to turn gods against each other... Something is amiss.",
    "The answer to this as yet eludes me. I fail to see the connection between kidnapping Death and turning gods against each other.",
    "What is clear is that he is setting in motion dangerous events, and we cannot let him continue.",
    "I suspect that the deaths here are more significant than the others I have seen. I must lay eyes upon the clues you have collected mortal.",
    "It is just as I expected. The person you are looking for is a devious Mahjarrat called Sliske. I believe he may also be connected to Death's disappearance.",
    "The question is: why? Kidnapping Death and attempting to turn gods against each other... Something is amiss.",
    "Recently he slew Guthix, the god of balance. Now no one is sure of his whereabouts, or the power he possesses.",
    "They are powerful, long-lived and war hungry. Do not trust them mortal, as they will stab you in the back when you need them most.",
    "The answer to this as yet eludes me. I fail to see the connection between kidnapping Death and turning gods against each other.",
    "What is clear is that he is setting in motion dangerous events, and we cannot let him continue.",
    "I would ask for your help, mortal. You have seen the evil at work here, and now you know the truth...",
    "Our highest priority is- wait... Something is wrong.",
    "Prepare yourself, adventurer. I sense the approach of undead.",
    "Well fought, mortal. I am not accustomed to undead withstanding my power...",
    "Ordinarily I would dispatch tens of wights with a wave of my hand, but these...",
    "It seemed almost as though they were attuned to my power. Like something was protecting them.",
    "These seemed almost as though they were attuned to my power. Like something was protecting them.",
    "Hmm, a peculiar object. There's some sort of mask affixed to the lid.",
    "What in the Underworld is that?",
    "What is your purpose, strange creature?",
    "Speak clearly, mask. What event? Who is your master?",
    "In light of recent events he must believe he has obtained godhood.",
    "This mask must be mad to believe I'd ever respond to an invitation sent by that back-stabbing snake.",
    "You would have the audacity to kidnap Death himself? Do you know nothing of the consequences?",
    "You would dare invoke the wrath of a god?",
    "Do not include me in your deceptions, traitor. Release Death immediately.",
    "Sliske?",
    "It would seem he has us cornered, mortal.",
    "With Death gone, Sliske knew I would come to the surface world to deal with the trapped souls.",
    "After killing the people you see here, he predicted my arrival and left his wights to ambush me.",
    "But they were just a show of his power. The real purpose was to deliver his invitation. Kidnapping Death leaves me no choice but to attend his ascension.",
    "Ah yes, this is the key to his master plan. I believe he is hatching similar schemes to also force the other gods into attendance.",
    "The piece of the puzzle before you seeks to turn Seren and Saradomin against each other.",
    "If they have both returned to Gielinor and believe each other to be at the citadel, they will likely attend in order to confront one another.",
    "If I am correct, Sliske will have a plan in place for each god, and the situation is more dire than I first believed.",
    "I was right to seek your help, adventurer. The evidence you gathered has been invaluable, if Sliske is gathering the gods in one place who knows what he may do.",
    "And to make matters worse he has kidnapped Death. I cannot stand by and allow what ever madness he is planning to unfold.",
    "You need not concern yourself with this, mortal.",
    "Rest assured, Sliske will answer for his crimes.",
    "Still, I cannot bring myself to trust this box.",
    "No. It is a fact I am well aware of. First, I must transport these souls to Death's mansion. After that it seems we have only one option.",
    "The souls are in safe hands with Death's helpers. Open the box when you are ready to be teleported to the citadel, adventurer.",
    "We must exercise caution adventurer, we were given this by Sliske after all... Are you sure you wish to open it?",
    "There are many high-ranking followers here. Evidently I was not the first to receive an invitation.",
    "You may speak to those present for more information or notify me if you are ready to proceed.",
    "It would be more effective for us to split up and search for Death.",
    "If I use my invitation to enter the main chamber, you can infiltrate the rest of the citadel.",
    "My sister has gone mad, mortal. She summons creatures to devour the souls that I strive to protect.",
    "I cannot help while her beasts relentlessly harry me in the underworld. My task is too important, and the stakes are too high.",
    "I teeter on the brink of failure, but you can succeed. I believe she can be saved. Redeem her adventurer... You must.",
    "I see Sliske's managed to bend you all to his will as well, then.",
    "I am a god and the recipient of an invitation, same as you.",
    "We are all gods here, gathered for the same purpose. We must be wary of Sliske's plot.",
    "Yet here we all are. The most gods assembled in one place in all of history. And I am sure, like I, you were persuaded...",
    "You were once a Mahjarrat, same as he. Sliske knew you would come to witness another of your kind ascend.",
    "It is the rest of us that have been manipulated.",
    "Saradomin, you must see how Sliske lured you here.",
    "Even the attack itself was a set up. Had Seren returned she would also be here, manipulated by the same plot as you.",
    "You know as well as anyone. I would not trust this pretender in a millennium.",
    "He has kidnapped Death. What is a god of the Underworld if there is no death?",
    "Enough! I am not alone in my search, and we will find him.",
    "For all we know you haven't gained any power at all.",
    "You wouldn't dare!",
    "Let him out of the cage.",
    "Welcome, mortal.",
    "Get on with it, Mahjarrat. You're trying our patience.",
    "The Stone of Jas?",
    "This will cause an all-out war on the gods!",
    "Be careful what you say here, mortal. The gods do not forget.",
    "Open your eyes - Sliske is manipulating you all. He is not to be trusted!",
    "Why did he give you the key?",
    "Get Death out, fast! I'm not sure I can hold this!",
    "Quickly - free Death from his cage and return to my side. This shield won't hold!",
    "I'm glad I encountered you today, mortal. You proved a valuable ally.",
    "There is much work to be done. I have duties to attend to in the Underworld.",
    "We must be cautious. Gods will fall in the coming days. The Stone of Jas is too powerful to be ignored.",
    "Some may fight, some may go for Sliske, some may employ other tactics. But everyone will want the stone.",
    "Make no mistake, adventurer. These are grave times, we all have a part to play.",
    "This is the most pivotal event to have occurred for thousands of years. The consequences will shape a new future.",
    "Gratitude for your help, mortal. Our paths will cross again, I am sure.",
    "I am afraid he had many bargaining chips. However, the events that transpired were of greater importance."

    "Perhaps. Now, if any of you want to take the risk, be my guest.",
    "No? I thought not... Now where were we?",
    "Well, well, well - the guest of honour has arrived. You're late.",
    "He/she has demonstrated certain... talents. What's the matter, Bandos? Jealous?",
    "\u200bHow touching",
    "\u200bHow touching.",
    "How touching.",
    "How touching.",
    "Haha! Did you not think I was aware of this? I am familiar with your 'servitude' to Zaros. Soran speaks highly of you.",
    "How touching.",
    "Controversial. I'd love to hear everyone's opinions but there are matters at hand.",
    "Moving on! You are just in time for the main event. Oh yes, an event for the ages. Sliske's.. Grand.. Ascendancy!",
    "Are you sitting comfortably?",
    "Hahaha! Adorable! I like this one.",
    "I'm running the show now, and you're going to want to hear what I have to say.",
    "Ooo feisty! 'Charlatan', he says - coming from the usurper himself. Interesting.",
    "Yes, yes. I can see you're all desperate to know what this is all about.",
    "Well, I happened across a couple of items. Artefacts, you might say. Of the elder variety.",
    "Indeed. You'd only need to ask a certain recently deceased god to find that out. I have managed to acquire not only your staff, but also the Stone of Jas.",
    "You didn't notice I dressed up for you, Zamorak?",
    "Really though, I'm glad you asked. Believe it or not, I don't go around kidnapping dragonkin for fun. There's a certain... method to the madness.",
    "Angry thing, isn't he? Those of you who were paying attention will have noticed him calling me a 'false user'.",
    "While I don't like being referred to as 'false', it doesn't take a genius to figure that one out.",
    "You ought to be careful then, hadn't you Saradomin?",
    "A good magician never reveals his secrets, does he? Fortunately for you I'm not a magician!",
    "It really was quite trivial, turns out the dragonkin are a remarkably predictable race. I was hoping for more of a challenge.",
    "You can see how angry it makes them, can't you? 'Destroy the false user!' It's highly amusing, actually.",
    "Anyway, I simply lured poor Strisath into the Shadow Realm. In he charged, screaming like a big, scaly baby.",
    "Then before he knew it...trapped. Nowhere to run.",
    "Must I answer all these boring questions? It really was quite simple.",
    "Why do you think I trapped this dragonkin specifically? I could have taken my pick. They're all the same, really.",
    "Strisath was unlucky enough to be guarding the staff. He couldn't have left it unattended now, could he?",
    "Haha! I could hardly believe it myself! Into the shadow realm he comes, carrying none other than the Staff of Armadyl itself.",
    "Oh, yes - an ingenious plan, I must say. It took an even more ingenious plan of my own to outplay you there.",
    "I really am quite proud of this one. I've been experimenting with the Staff of Armadyl and found it to be an extremely versatile tool.",
    "With Strisath imprisoned, I used the Staff to reveal his connection to the Stone, leading me to exactly where you sent it.",
    "Not far from my own doorstep, believe it or not. I wonder what the odds were of you sending it into the caves beneath the Barrows!",
    "Believe it or not, it was deep in a cavern not far from Guthix's resting place.",
    "Annoyingly, you managed to teleport it deep beneath Trollheim. To say it wasn't easy to retrieve it is putting it mildly.",
    "Annoyingly, you managed to teleport it into the deep sea near Crandor. To say it wasn't easy to retrieve it is putting it mildly.",
    "Annoyingly, it was frozen in ice beneath the Temple of the Lost Ancients. To say it wasn't easy to retrieve it is putting it mildly.",
    "Oh, how I love cheating games of chance. Especially when I hit the jackpot!",
    "Ahaha! You really believe I brought you here so you could have answers? No, no, no - there will be no ascendancy today.",
    "I wouldn't want to spoil the fun now, would I? It's highly amusing keeping you all guessing - you're just dying to know!",
    "Oh, but you can't be tired of the games. They have only just begun! Besides Bandos, you're going to really like this one.",
    "It's time for the real announcement. I am holding a contest. A free-for-all, you might say. A battle of the gods!",
    "Not so fast Zamorak, you might want to stick around for the next part. It's really going to heat up!",
    "You really are no fun at all, are you Saradomin? This is the calm before the storm. You should savour the moment.",
    "It's not so much a game - more survival of the fittest. There is only one rule, you see.",
    "It is only a matter of time until our moon - Zanaris - passes the sun, resulting in a total eclipse. Gielinor will be engulfed in shadow.",
    "It is at this exact moment the contest will end...",
    "...and the winner will be the person who has killed the most gods.",
    "Because, Armadyl, there's a prize. Just one little prize that I think you might all be interested in.",
    "On the day at which the sun is eclipsed, someone will stand victorious with most of you defeated.",
    "And to that person I will gift...",
    "...the Stone of Jas.",
    "Haha! A little lost for words are we? Pick your next moves carefully. I wonder who will score the first kill!",
    "Well, that's for me to know, isn't it? Survive if you can, Zamorak - maybe then I'll let you in on my secrets.",
    "What's the matter? Scared Bandos will crush you? Maybe you should be more tactical, you know? Pick off the weaker gods...",
    "And what about our honourable guest? How do you feel about this, adventurer?",
    "Haha! Another loyal follower. Maybe you'll consider taking your rightful place as one of my Barrows brothers.",
    "Silence! Enough of this petty arguing. If you won't do it, then I'll kick things off myself."
