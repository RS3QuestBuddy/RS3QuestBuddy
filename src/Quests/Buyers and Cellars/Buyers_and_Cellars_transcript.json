    "Greetings! Any news of late?",
    "Thanks. Lumbridge Guild of Thieves?",
    "Why is that necessarily madness?",
    "Mind if I hang on to this?",
    "Thanks.",
    "Hmm... 'Darren Lightfinger, Chancellor of the Lumbridge Guild of Thieves, requests your presence at the First Annual Selection of Appointees.' 'If you have ever dreamed of making a name for yourself, and making your fortune at the same time, now is the best opportunity you will ever have!' 'The world-renowned Lumbridge Guild of Thieves is recruiting new members to be shown a new world of profit and derring-do' 'Commisions, fame and the adulation of your peers and of the opposite sex will be your fate as a successful applicant.' 'and your life will never again be the same!' It says to apply to the Lumbridge Guildhouse. Wonder where that is...",
    "Hello there.",
    "That's an appropriate name.",
    "Are you the poor in question?",
    "How long have you known the Guildmaster?",
    "Bye for now.",
    "Don't let me stop you.",
    "Is this it? The 'world-renowned' guild is a cellar with two blokes and a straw dummy lurking in it?",
    "How long has this guild been in operation?",
    "Yes?",
    "And what is it you need done?",
    "Really? You amaze me.",
    "I take it you have some sort of plan for doing this?",
    "From the bank's vault.",
    "Its owner being?",
    "You seem to be assuming a certain amount here.",
    "Sorry, I was just leaving.",
    "I see. Well, good luck with that.",
    "What are you doing down here?",
    "Do tell.",
    "No, thank you.",
    "Sorry, I was just leaving.",
    "Oh, very well.",
    "What can you teach me?",
    "No, I think I've got the hang of this.",
    "Can we get started? I'm ready.",
    "Can we get started? I'm ready.",
    "Yes.",
    "Thanks.",
    "Remind me again?",
    "Why can't you do this?",
    "Hello there.",
    "I'm always willing to learn.",
    "Thanks, Robin.",
    "I\u2019ve got it, thanks.",
    "Any advice for me? The guildmaster says you'll be shadowing me on this operation.",
    "Anything I should know?",
    "See you there, then.",
    "Bye for now.",
    "Can we try out that testing dummy again?",
    "How's the guild coming along these days?",
    "I'd like to talk about the caper I'm doing for you.",
    "Not yet.",
    "Not yet, but I\u2019m in its trail.",
    "Robin and I have a plan to get the key off its owner.",
    "Sorry, I was just leaving.",
    "Um, does it?",
    "Go ahead.",
    "Who'd want to live in a swamp?",
    "Looks like that's my next stop, anyway.",
    "Not right now.",
    "That's a nice chalice.",
    "Aren't you afraid it will be taken in lieu of mortgage payments?",
    "The bailiffs are coming! Quick: hide the valuables!",
    "Can I have a look at that chalice?",
    "I meant...a closer look.",
    "Can I hold it?",
    "Bye then.",
    "Hmm, I'll need something more urgent to draw his eye. Perhaps Robin can help.",
    "Mumble mumble mumble!",
    "Father Urhney over in the swamp has the chalice in his hut, but I can't get the key off him.",
    "Is that not highly irresponsible?",
    "That's a nice chalice.",
    "Fire! FIRE!",
    "Fire! FIRE!",
    "Ha, now's my chance to pick his pocket while he's distracted...",
    "Nice... um... never mind. Bye!",
    "I stole Father Urhney's chalice!",
    "I'd like to talk about the caper I'm doing for you.",
    "I have!",
    "Your buyer is still interested, I hope?",
    "Well, the chalice wasn't where you said it was, nor was the owner; I just wanted to make sure you had something right in all of this.",
    "It wasn't actually a joke, to be honest.",
    "Sorry, I was just leaving."

  "Man": [
    "Some big fellow came up to me a while ago and gave me this nonsense.",
    "The fellow must have been insane.",
    "This is Lumbridge! I could imagine a thieves' guild in Ardougne or Burthope, but all we have here is root cellars! And it was a root cellar that the fellow ran off to, to boot.",
    "Not at all; I don't want this."

  "Chief Thief Robin": [
    "Greetings. I'm Robin, the Guildmaster's assistant. Now, what can I do for you?",
    "Yes, I've never heard that one before. Still, it's not so bad... If I hadn't been mocked for my name as a lad, I might never have decided in a fit of ironic pique to learn how to rob from the rich and give to the poor.",
    "Well, I was. Having given myself the goods stolen from several rich people, I'm now of limited but comfortable means. Now, what can I do for you?",
    "Oh, some time now. We started in business together when he was a con artist, talking people into handing over their hard-earned valuables with lies and vague promises of reward. Obviously, that's all behind us now. Now, what can I do for you?",
    "The Guildmaster wanted me to be on hand in case you needed some more hints on picking pockets. Now, what can I do for you?",
    "When you're on the prowl for pickpocketing targets, it should be fairly obvious who's not paying enough attention to the world around them. Just saunter up to them all casual-like, then dip your hand into their wallets as gently and as neatly as you can. If you succeed, you'll get some of the contents of their pockets; it not, they'll likely punch you in the face, so be warned. It stings, and you'll need a moment to gather your wits.",
    "You can use the training dummy if you'd like, but after a while you'll need to switch to real marks if you want to improve. Now, what can I do for you?",
    "You can use the training dummy if you\u2019d like, but after a while you\u2019ll need to switch to real marks if you want to improve. Now, what can I do for you?",
    "Yes, I'm heading out to the castle shortly to pick up any information that might help you.",
    "This caper should be simple enough, since your mark won't be on his guard. I'll be able to tell you more once I've had a chance to look around, but it should be a matter of finding the chalice's owner, stealing the key, and taking the chalice out of the bank.",
    "The purple owl croaks at dawn...",
    "Oh, never mind. I've some information for you.",
    "The chalice is no longer being held by the bank. Seems that the owner withdrew it a couple of days ago and wandered off in the direction of Lumbridge Swamp...a wild-haired old man with a bad temper.",
    "Someone who wants to be left alone, I imagine.",
    "No violence, if you please. We're thieves, not muggers, and priests tend to be well in with the gods. Be subtle...if an adventurer can be subtle. See if you can pick his pocket for the key. Good luck.",
    "You might have to engineer a crisis, then. Don't go setting fire to his house, though! A fire outside his window should do the trick.",
    "Normally I'd say yes, but that swamp is so marshy there's little danger of burning his house down and rendering him homeless. There should be some nice damp wood in that swamp.",
    "You might want to deliver it, then. I'll see you there."

  "Darren Lightfinger": [
    "Ah, come in, come in! I was just about to get started!",
    "Ladies and gentlemen of Lumbridge! Tonight, I stand before you to offer you the ultimate in opportunities! I offer you the chance to make your mark on a society rife with imbalance and folly. I offer you the chance to redistribute the wealth of our very civilization! I offer you the freedom to live your life without the need to worry whether your rent will be paid this month. I offer you the skills to pay your way through the costs everyone must face. I offer you vengeance against those who take and take yet give nothing in return. I offer you justice at its most fundamental level! Some will say that I am a scofflaw, a thief, a brigand... These people are correct! But if I scoff at the law, it is because the law as we know it is a tool that 'The Man' is using purely to keep us in our place. If I thieve, it is from those who have more than they deserve and more than they need. And if I am a brigand, it is only by the standards of those whom I, er, brig. If you join me I can offer you every opportunity for reward and for fame, or at least infamy. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to your destiny. Welcome to the preliminary course, you fine members-in-waiting of the underworld gentry! Here you will discover the techniques, the tricks, the training and the trials that mark your passage into this hidden elite. Here you will become the best of the best, joining the ranks of the steely-eyed exploiters of this world's bloated social parasites in a quest for community justice and personal enrichment! You will - Yes, we have a question?",
    "Well...",
    "...",
    "Two weeks.",
    "Here's what we need: money!",
    "I know it's hardly the most high-flying goal, but we need to start somewhere. To be precise, we need to start by expanding this cellar into a headquarters befitting a major player on the global crime stage.",
    "Of course I do. In Lumbridge Castle's bank is a golden chalice of particular workmanship and value. I have found a willing buyer for it, and now it merely remains to 'collect' the item in question.",
    "Correct! And since the vault is not easily breached, we shall need the key from its owner.",
    "I shall send my right-hand man, Robin, to determine that as soon as I may. He shall be around to brief you in the castle grounds. Then you must merely acquire the key by stealth or by force, open the vault, return the chalice and...",
    "Oh, but of course you'll help! I can offer you the best of training and the greatest of rewards for your assistance... In fact, let me have a look at your techniques and see what we can do with you.",
    "Why, recruiting! Recruiting agents for a glorious destiny and fantastical missions of derring-do. White suits, classy cocktails, fast carts\u2026a wealth of rewards await my guild\u2019s members! If only I could have convinced Ozan to sign on with us. Such a pity\u2026 A master thief like him would have been perfect for my plans. Anyways, would you like to stay for the explanation?",
    "Splendid! Let's get you set up, then. This is the Mark 1 training dummy. It is designed for maximum pocket size and minimum observational skills, which, seeing as it is made of wood, straw and canvas, was not hard to achieve. It will suffice for early training and for testing, but if you have any talent at all it will not be of use to you for long.",
    "Right, I want you to pick the pocket of that dummy as sneakily and as delicately as you possibly can.",
    "That was very nicely done, young sir/madam. I think you're quite ready enough for the big wide world. Unless you'd like some advice?",
    "Just keep picking that dummy's enormous canvas pockets and I'll give you the benefit of my wisdom.",
    "Excellent! Have a word with me again in a second, then, and we'll get you on your way.",
    "Greetings, my young recruit! You return!",
    "Excellent! I shall let Robin know he should expect you, then. You know what to do?",
    "Best of luck then.",
    "Head over to Lumbridge Castle's courtyard; Robin should have found out the identity of the chalice's owner by then. At that point, you just need to get the key by any means necessary, open the vault and then come back here with the chalice.",
    "Oh, Robin and I are both too well known; anyone with valuables would be instantly on their guard. No, I'm afraid it will have to be you doing the dirty work this time. Don't worry, you'll get a chance to see me in action some other time!",
    "Greetings, my young recruit!",
    "Of course!",
    "We're really only getting started at the moment. I've made a training dummy to practice on, but we'll need funds if we're to begin to command any respect. Anything else I can do for you?",
    "Have you retrieved the chalice?",
    "Head to Lumbridge Castle as soon as you may, then; Robin will meet you there.",
    "Greetings, my young recruit!",
    "Have you retrieved the chalice?",
    "Fantastic work! I knew I had chosen wisely when I recruited you. Now we can expand the guild and do some proper training around here.",
    "Yes, of course. Why?",
    "Ha! I do appreciate a sense of humour in my members.",
    "To be honest? You don't want to be honest, you're a member of the illustrious Thieves' Guild! Now get out there and make me proud...and both of us rich."

    "It's the eye of the kyat, it's the will of the heist... Again!",
    "Handkerchief on, handkerchief off. Well, no, just handkerchief off, actually. Again!",
