    "Ah, you wish to learn more about Rasial, I presume.",
    "Hmm. Very well, but we should start small. Let me tell you more of vessels, and the fate that befell a somewhat recent apprentice of Rasial.",
    "A vessel is just a name we give to a place in which many souls reside. I created the Well of Souls, a sanctuary for those who die and know not what comes next for them.",
    "Many necromancers end up creating their own vessels, a place in which they can consolidate their power and grow it over time. More souls, more power.",
    "It is not wholly dissimilar from godhood, though with souls other than one's own, and against their will.",
    "In fact, you have previously dealt with at least one such a necromancer and their vessel in your past.",
    "I believe his name is Necrovarus, and his vessel being the Ectofuntus of Port Phasmatys.",
    "Necrovarus was a one-time apprentice of Rasial's. Who better to teach you of what Rasial has in store for you than a former pupil wronged by him?",
    "How goes your investigation into Necrovarus and his vessel?",
    "He had to put the souls of Um that he stole somewhere. I suspect his own vessel is housed within his citadel.",
    "Whenever you make your way there, keep an eye out for what it could be. They can be made to look like anything.",
    "Hmm, he speaks true, but your attempts are not futile. You would not catch up with him in terms of raw available energy even across many lifetimes.",
    "He has clearly been working on this plan for centuries. However, we will find a way. Perhaps there is something more in your approach to necromancy.",
    "Still, I believe we have learned all we are likely to from Necrovarus. Continue your training and return to me after you have visited Rasial's citadel.",
    "You need to free up two spaces in your backpack."

    "Maybe soon. I have something else to take care of first.",
    "So, I have a little bit of experience as a necromancer. Will you tell me some more about Rasial now?",
    "Vessels? The Well of Souls isn't the only one?",
    "I have? Who?",
    "Necrovarus? What would this teach of Rasial?",
    "Ah, of course. Thank you. In that case, I will head to Port Phasmatys and see what I can learn from Necrovarus.",
    "Necromancers do a lot more running around than I'd have expected...but I'm making progress.",
    "Necrovarus. I-",
    "I'm not here to berate you. I actually need your help.",
    "I wouldn't be here if it wasn't necessary. Death sent me.",
    "The necromancer Rasial is causing havoc in the Underworld.",
    "He's already drained the City of Um of its souls, and wants to take over Gielinor with an army of undead.",
    "I have been chosen as his apprentice, as I have been told you once were.",
    "Not yet, at least.",
    "Of course you do.",
    "You're welcome.",
    "This isn't quite the evil deed I was expecting from you. Helping to cleanse souls now, are we?",
    "Whatever you say.",
    "What evil deed do I need to do again?",
    "I need another soul urn.",
    "That should be all the tortured souls I need. Now they just need cleansing with some ectoplasm at the Ectofuntus.",
    "I have cleansed the tortured souls for you.",
    "Now, you said you'd help me with the Rasial situation?",
    "Trap?",
    "But something went wrong.",
    "Well, weren't you also a human?",
    "...",
    "Is there anything you suggest I do to try and stop Rasial?",
    "How can I perform this ritual?",
    "That sounds about right - I was the one who gave it to her.",
    "That shouldn't take me too long. If I recall, she lives just east of the Slayer tower.",
    "What should I be doing again?",
    "Hmm... What's this?",
    "Unpaid bills... An advert for a new flavour of nettle tea... An apology note from Dr Fenkenstrain about some building work he's having done...",
    "...A subscription to Witches Weekly... And a letter signed by 'V'?",
    "V... for Velorina? Maybe she knows where Netty is. I can probably still find her in Port Phasmatys.",
    "My expertise in Thieving would be of no use here, I guess.",
    "This looks like it hasn't been slept in for quite a while.",
    "Apologies.",
    "Hi Velorina. I don't suppose you've seen Netty around recently?",
    "Hear what?",
    "Oh, I'm sorry for your loss. What happened?",
    "At least she died doing what she loved.",
    "Well, I appreciate the information on where I can find Netty now. Thank you, Velorina.",
    "Where is Netty again?",
    "Thanks.",
    "Hi Ted, have you seen anyone pass through here called Netty?",
    "I'll head over there. Thanks, Ted.",
    "Netty?",
    "Indeed, I'm not dead yet!",
    "Oh. That's curious.",
    "I... suppose I don't?",
    "I'm currently learning necromancy to take down Rasial.",
    "That's the one.",
    "It sounds like you're having a wonderful time down here.",
    "...",
    "Right... tea... sorry. I actually came here hoping to get something from you to use against Rasial.",
    "You recall the book of Haricanto I gave to you? Necrovarus needs it back so he can teach me a ritual.",
    "I will ensure Necrovarus will use it wisely.",
    "I don't imagine I can just turn up to a bank and ask for your belongings.",
    "Anything else?",
    "The what?",
    "I'll be off then! Enjoy your tea.",
    "I lost your documents.",
    "Hello Netty. Where can I find the book of Haricanto again?",
    "Thank you!",
    "I'm here to claim a key belonging to a previous resident of Morytania, Netty.",
    "I have her will and death certificate right here with me.",
    "Er... At least I did?",
    "Thank you!",
    "I er... lost Netty's key.",
    "I'll make sure to look after this one.",
    "Are you okay?",
    "Your whole... life? When you were a human, you wanted to be a bodyguard for a chest?",
    "Well, your dream came true. Is it not living up to what you thought it would be?",
    "I'm sure you have some redeeming qualities that help!",
    "Any old skeleton, you say?",
    "Hmm...",
    "I don't have any space in my backpack to take the book.",
    "Phew...",
    "I... long story. All that matters is that I have the book of Haricanto here with me.",
    "I'm flattered.",
    "See you there.",
    "What are we doing again?",
    "Why don't you move to the City of Um to use it then?",
    "This should help to fight Rasial.",
    "Are you afraid I might learn something I shouldn't?",
    "My vessel grows stronger, and I with it.",
    "So, Rasial has his own vessel... Not surprising, but good to confirm it. I should return to Death and share what I've learned.",
    "So, I found out that Rasial used Necrovarus to learn how to build a more powerful vessel, one he is using now.",
    "He suggested my connection with the Well of Souls could never match his. Is this all futile?",
    "Perhaps."

    "Rasial... He never gives up, does he?",
    "So, you are in dire need of my help.",
    "I want something in return first.",
    "As much as I hate to admit it, the Ectofuntus has been much stronger since Port Phasmatys's souls have been given freedom.",
    "Quiet, mortal.",
    "However, this does mean that these miserable tortured souls outside of the town are preventing the Ectofuntus from reaching its full potential.",
    "You must gather their souls for me in this urn. To do so, you must defeat them with necromancy. Five souls will be sufficient.",
    "You fool. Come back when you have a free space in your backpack.",

    "A trap indeed. A temporary downfall of my otherwise great power!",
    "Now that you're his apprentice, as yes, I once was, you must be careful. Rasial is intelligent and ambitious, with cunning schemes to achieve his plans.",
    "My history with Rasial began back before the transformation of Port Phasmatys. I was a young and impressively evil necromancer, with a specialisation in vessels.",
    "Rasial came to me in the eastern lands, and spoke tales of ectoplasm under Port Phasmatys.",
    "Although I was wary, he was powerful and intelligent, so I followed his word. Of course, his word turned out to be true.",
    "The next part of the story you already know. The Ectofuntus, my own vessel, was built to contain the spirits and ectoplasm of Port Phasmatys and provide me with power.",
    "Rasial observed as my power grew - as the vessel slowly usurped the souls of the town. Things were going so well!",
    "Something went very wrong... Unaccounted for in my studies. As well as the mere human souls, the vessel also began to suck away at my lifeforce.",
    "Yes, but I am its master! I should have retained pure control of it, not the other way around!",
    "...",
    "Rasial did nothing. He quietly learned, and left me in this viridescent form.",
    "And so I have a special hatred in my heart for that necromancer. If you're not careful, you may end up with the same fate.",
    "I can help you perform a ritual to empower your vessel, the Well of Souls. Whilst the ritual itself may not stop him wholly, it may give you more power to take him down.",
    "Now that... I cannot remember. It has been many years since I last performed it.",
    "The book of Haricanto will contain the information we require. I have heard whisperings that it was last in the hands of one of my disgraced disciples, Netty.",
    "I will ignore your subversion for now. Get the book from Netty, and return to me once you have it.",
    "Bother me not with the details. Goodbye.",
    "You need to return me the book of Haricanto. Last I was aware, my old disciple Netty had it, east of the Slayer Tower.",
    "Where have you been, mortal?",
    "I wouldn't have expected you to be so witless as to return without it.",
    "Do not grow accustomed to it. We are merely working together due to a shared enemy.",
    "Now, you will need to gather some special ectoplasm from the Ectofuntus itself, in a bucket, to focus the ritual on.",
    "Once that is done, let us meet by the ritual site in the City of Um, where you can perform the empower vessel ritual.",
    "How many times must I iterate such simple instructions!",
    "Gather some ectoplasm from the Ectofuntus with a bucket. Then, meet me at the City of Um ritual site where you can perform the empower vessel ritual.",
    "A ritual site of this splendour would be perfect for an evil necromancer like myself. It is wasted on the likes of you.",
    "Alas, I much enjoy the power from my Ectofuntus. My disciples would surely also miss me too much.",
