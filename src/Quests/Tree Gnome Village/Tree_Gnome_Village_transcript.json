    "Hello Elkoy.",
    "No, I'm afraid not.",
    "I have it here.",
    "Yes please.",
    "Hello Elkoy. I have the orb.",

    "Hello Elkoy.",
    "No, I'm afraid not.",
    "Yes please.",
    "Hello Elkoy.",
    "Yes please.",
    "Hello Elkoy.",
    "Thanks.",

    "Hello Remsai.",
    "No, I'm afraid not.",

    "Are you ok?",
    "I've returned.",
    "Hello Bolren.",
    "Ok, I'll try my best.",
    "Hello Bolren.",
    "Hello.",
    "I've been sent by King Bolren to retrieve the orb of protection.",
    "What can I do?",
    "Ok, I'll gather some wood.",
    "Sorry I no longer want to be involved.",
    "Hello.",
    "I'll see what I can do.",
    "Hello.",
    "I have some here.(You give six loads of logs to the commander.)",
    "How are you doing Montai?",
    "So what's the problem?",
    "Have they returned?",
    "No, I've had enough of your battle.",
    "I'll try my best.",
    "Hello.",
    "Do you know the coordinates of the Khazard stronghold?",
    "Well done.",
    "OK, take care.",
    "Hello again.",
    "How are you tracker?",
    "Hello.",
    "Are you OK?",
    "I'm sorry little man.",
    "Well done.",

    "Hello again.",
    "How are you tracker?",
    "Hello.",
    "Are you OK?",
    "What's wrong?",
    "What do you mean?",
    "Do you have the coordinate for the Khazard stronghold?",
    "What?",
    "You're mad.",
    "I'll pray for you little man.",
    "Hello again.",
    "Hello.",
    "I think you do.",
    "I've got no hope of hitting the stronghold without knowing any of the coordinates. Maybe I should ask Montai's tracker gnomes for more coordinates.",
    "I'm not going to be able to hit the stronghold while I only know its height coordinate. Maybe I should ask Montai's other tracker gnomes for more coordinates.",
    "Maybe I should ask the other tracker gnome for the x-coordinate.",
    "That tracker gnome was a bit vague about the x coordinate! What could it be?",
    "Evidently that wasn't the right x coordinate.",
    "I've breached the stronghold.",
    "I've come for the orb.",
    "I have the orb of protection.",
    "Thanks... I think!",
    "Hello little man.",
    "Hello Bolren.",
    "No, I'm afraid not.",
    "I have the orb.",
    "King Bolren, are you OK?",
    "What happened?",
    "Who?",
    "I'm sorry.",
    "Where did they take them?",
    "I will find the warlord and bring back the orbs.",
    "I'm sorry but I can't help.",
    "Hello Bolren.",
    "Hi.",
    "Hello Montai, how are you?",
    "Hang in there.",
    "Hello there.",
    "What?",
    "You there, stop!",
    "I've come for the orbs.",
    "They're stolen goods, now give them here!",
    "I thought I killed you?",
    "Hello gnome.",
    "Bolren, I have returned.",
    "I have them here.",
    "What does the ceremony involve?",
    "I'm pleased I could help.",
    "Thank you King Bolren."

  "King Bolren": [
    "Well hello stranger. My name's Bolren, I'm the king of the tree gnomes. I'm surprised you made it in, maybe I made the maze too easy.",
    "I'm afraid I have more serious concerns at the moment. Very serious.",
    "Ok, take care.",
    "I'm glad you asked. The truth is my people are in grave danger. We have always been protected by the Spirit Tree. No creature of dark can harm us while its three orbs are in place. We are not a violent race, but we fight when we must. Many gnomes have fallen battling the dark forces of Khazard to the North. We became desperate, so we took one orb of protection to the battlefield. It was a foolish move. Khazard troops seized the orb. Now we are completely defenceless.",
    "You would be a huge benefit on the battlefield. If you would go there and try to retrieve the orb, my people and I will be forever grateful.",
    "Ok then, travel safe.",
    "Thank you. The battlefield is to the north of the maze. Commander Montai will inform you of their current situation. That is if he's still alive. My assistant shall guide you out. Good luck friend, try your best to return the orb.",
    "Hello traveller, we must retrieve the orb. It's being held by Khazard troops north of here.",
    "The orb is being held at the battlefield north of the maze.",
    "Do you have the orb?",
    "Please, we must have the orb if we are to survive.",
    "Oh my... The misery, the horror!",
    "Thank you traveller, but it's too late. We're all doomed.",
    "They came in the night. I don't know how many, but enough.",
    "Khazard troops. They slaughtered anyone who got in their way. Women, children, my wife.",
    "They took the other orbs, now we are defenceless.",
    "They headed north of the stronghold. A warlord carries the orbs.",
    "You are brave, but this task will be tough even for you. I wish you the best of luck. Once again you are our only hope.",
    "I will safeguard this orb and pray for your safe return. My assistant will guide you out.",
    "I understand, this isn't your battle.",
    "The orbs are gone, taken north of the battlefield by a Khazard warlord.",
    "You made it back! Do you have the orbs?",
    "Hooray, you're amazing. I didn't think it was possible but you've saved us. Once the orbs are replaced we will be safe once more. We must begin the ceremony immediately.",
    "The spirit tree has looked over us for centuries. Now we must pay our respects.",
    "Now at last my people are safe once more. We can live in peace again.",
    "You are modest brave traveller. Please, for your efforts take this amulet. It's made from the same sacred stone as the orbs of protection. It will help keep you safe on your journeys.",
    "The tree has many other powers, some of which I cannot reveal. As a friend of the gnome people, I can now allow you to use the tree's magic to teleport to other trees grown from related seeds."

  "Elkoy": [
    "We're out of the maze now. Please hurry, we must have the orb if we are to survive.",
    "Oh my! The orb, they have the orb. We're doomed.",
    "Would you like me to show you the way to the village?",
    "Would you like me to show you the way out of the village?",
    "Here we are. I hope you get the orb back soon.",
    "Ok then, take care.",
    "You must retrieve the orb, or the gnome village is doomed.",
    "Would you like me to guide you there?",
    "Would you like me to show you the way out?",
    "You're back! And the orb?",
    "Please, we must have the orb if we are to survive. Would you like me to show you the way to the village?",
    "You're our saviour. Please return it to the village and we are all saved. Would you like me to show you the way to the village?",
    "Ok then, follow me.",
    "Here we are. Take the orb to King Bolren, I'm sure he'll be pleased to see you.",
    "Here we are. I hope you get the orb back soon.",
    "Take it to King Bolren, I'm sure he'll be pleased to see you.",
    "If you like, but please take the orb to King Bolren soon.",
    "Here we are. Please don't lose the orb!",
    "You're back! And the orb?",
    "Please, we must have the orb if we are to survive. Would you like me to guide you out of the village so you can search for it?",
    "Here we are. I hope you get the orb back soon.",
    "Did you hear? Khazard's men have pillaged the village! They slaughtered many, and took the other orbs in an attempt to lead us out of the maze. When will the misery end?",
    "Would you like me to show you the way to the village?",
    "Shall I guide you out of the village?",
    "Ok then, follow me.",
    "Here we are. Despite what has happened here, I hope you feel welcome.",
    "Please try to get our orbs back for us, otherwise the village is doomed!",
    "You truly are a hero.",
    "You saved us by defeating the warlord. I'm humbled and wish you well.",
    "Would you like me to show you the way to the village?",
    "Would you like me to show you the way out?",
    "Ok then, follow me.",
    "Here we are. Feel free to have a look around.",
    "Here we are. Have a safe journey.",
    "Good luck friend."

  "Remsai": [
    "Oh my, oh my!",
    "The orb, they have the orb. It must be returned or we're doomed.",
    "Hello, did you find the orb?",
    "Please, we must have the orb if we are to survive.",
    "You're our saviour.",
    "Khazard's men came. Without the orb we were defenceless. They killed many and then took our last hope, the other orbs. Now surely we're all doomed. Without them the spirit tree is useless.",
    "You're back, well done brave adventurer. Now the orbs are safe we can perform the ritual for the spirit tree. We can live in peace once again."
  ],
  "Commander Montai": [
    "Hello traveller, are you here to help or just to watch?",
    "Excellent we need all the help we can get. I'm Commander Montai. The orb is in the Khazard stronghold to the north, but until we weaken their defences we can't get close.",
    "Firstly we need to strengthen our own defences. We desperately need wood to make more battlements, once the battlements are gone it's all over. Six loads of normal logs should do it.",
    "Please be as quick as you can, I don't know how much longer we can hold out.",
    "That's a shame, we could have done with your help.",
    "Hello again, we're still desperate for wood soldier. We need six loads of normal logs.",
    "Thank you.",
    "Hello again, we're still desperate for wood soldier.",
    "That's excellent, now we can make more defensive battlements. and then come speak to me. I'll inform you of our next phase of attack.",
    "We're hanging in there soldier. For the next phase of our attack we need to breach their stronghold. The ballista can break through the stronghold wall, and then we can advance and seize back the orb.",
    "From this distance we can't get an accurate enough shot. We need the correct coordinates of the stronghold for a direct hit. them.",
    "I'm afraid not, and we're running out of time. I need you to go into the heart of the battlefield, find the trackers, and bring back the coordinates. Do you think you can do it?",
    "I understand, this isn't your fight.",
    "Thank you, you're braver than most. I don't know how long I will be able to hold out. Once you have the coordinates come back and fire the ballista right into those monsters. If you can retrieve the orb and bring safety back to my people, none of the blood spilled on this field will be in vain.",
    "Hello warrior. We need the coordinates for a direct hit from the ballista. Once you have a direct hit you will be able to enter the stronghold and retrieve the orb.",
    "I saw, that was a beautiful sight. The Khazard troops didn't know what hit them. Now is the time to retrieve the orb. It's all in your hands. I'll be praying for you.",
    "Incredible, for a human you really are something.",
    "I'll stay here with my troops and try and hold Khazard's men back. You return the orb to the gnome village. Go as quick as you can, the village is still unprotected.",
    "I'm ok, this battle is going to take longer to win than I expected. The Khazard troops won't give up even without the orb."
  ],
  "Tracker gnome 1": [
    "I managed to get one, although it wasn't easy.",
    "The other two tracker gnomes should have the other coordinates if they're still alive.",
    "Well done, you've broken down their defences. This battle must be ours.",
    "Now we have the orb I'm much better. They won't stand a chance without it.",
    "When will this battle end? I feel like I've been fighting forever."
  ],
  "Tracker gnome 2": [
    "They caught me spying on the stronghold. They beat and tortured me. But I didn't crack. I told them nothing. They can't break me!",
    "Don't be. I have the position of the stronghold!",
    "Now leave before they find you and all is lost.",
    "Go!",
    "Well done, you've broken down their defences. This battle must be ours.",
    "Now we have the orb I'm much better. Soon my comrades will come and free me.",
    "When will this battle end? I feel like I've been locked up my whole life."

  "Tracker gnome 3": [
    "OK? Who's OK? Not me! Hee hee!",
    "You can't see me, no one can. Monsters, demons, they're all around me!",
    "They're dancing, all of them, hee hee.",
    "Who holds the stronghold?",
    "Less than my hands.",
    "More than my head.",
    "Less than our feet.",
    "Less than my fingers.",
    "My legs and your legs, ha ha ha!",
    "Dance with me, and Khazard's men are beat.",
    "All day we pray in the hay, hee hee.",
    "Don't talk to me, you can't see me. No one can, just the demons.",
    "I feel dizzy, where am I? Oh dear, oh dear I need some rest."

  "Khazard commander": [
    "What? How did you manage to get in here.",

  "Local Gnome": [
    "Little man stronger than big man. Hee hee, lardi dee, lardi da.",
    "Must save the orbs and kill the Khazard warlord. That will be fun, hee hee.",

    "You think you're so clever. You know nothing!",

    "Go back to your pesky little green friends.",
    "You're out of your depth traveller. These orbs are part of a much larger picture.",
    "Ha, you really think you stand a chance? I'll crush you.",
