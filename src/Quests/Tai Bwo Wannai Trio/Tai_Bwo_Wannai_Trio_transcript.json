    "My greatest respects Bwana. I have communed with my gods and the future looks good for my people. We are happy now that the gods are not angry with us. With some blessings we will be safe here. You should deliver the good news to Bwana Timfraku, Chief of Tai Bwo Wannai. He lives in a raised hut not far from here."

    "Then it must be true.",

    "No, I've had quite enough of the jungle already.",

    "How long have you been hunting the Shaikahan?",
    "When will you succeed?",
    "Lead the way.",
    "Take me on your next hunt for the Shaikahan.",
    "I could slay the Shaikahan for you.",
    "Tamayu, try using this weapon.",
    "Yes, you can keep it forever.",
    "No, I can't spare that.",
    "I've noticed you commenting on the Shaikahan's agility. Try using this.",
    "Tamayu, I have brought you more agility boosting nourishment.",

    "Gods! Witness this triumph!",
    "I did it! I, Tamayu, first son of Timfraku, did slay the Shaikahan! The deaths of my kin have been avenged. You are my witness.",
    "Yes. Go on ahead without me. I have further matters to attend to here. I will meet you in the village once you have helped my brothers and spoken to my father.",

    "Take a Karambwan vessel to my brother Tinsay. He is the academic amongst us. Tell him I have asked him to study it so that we may craft more of its type.",

    "Have you taken the Karambwan vessel to Tinsay?",
    "Please hurry! Time is of the essence!",

    "What a foolish question! Now leave!",
    "You again! I thought I told you to go away!",
    "So I see. What would a fool like you want with me?",
    "I am Lubufu, son of Kedoaba, brother of Kedenda and second cousin twice removed of Ibeli!",
    "Kedoaba is my father, the father of Kedenda and second uncle twice removed of Ibeli!",
    "Kedenda is the son of my father, my brother and second cousin twice removed of Ibeli!",
    "Ibeli is the second nephew twice removed of my father, and the second cousin twice removed of myself and my brother!",
    "Alas, no. Focussed[sic] and determined in my trade as I was, I never found a suitable wife. It is a great shame that the secret of the Karambwan has to die with me.",
    "Hah! What a stupid thought! The secret is mine and mine alone!",
    "Our island of Karamja. Long ago, before you were even a thought in the back of a mind, I used to play on these beaches with the pebbles and stones.",
    "Silence! As I grew older the ways of the world became apparent to me, and my attention turned from the rocks of the land to the fish in the sea.",
    "Despite what you might hear, there are plenty of fish in the sea! Especially when they can only be caught by me!",
    "Nowadays I mostly fish for Karambwan and collect their bait. Collecting the bait has become increasingly tiresome, what with my age and health.",
    "An order of magnitude older than you! What an impudent question! Collecting bait has become hard enough at this age as it is without having to endure the chiding of you young people!",
    "Hmm ... nobody I can recall right now.",
    "And why would you help me?",
    "Well perhaps you're right. It's nigh time I could do with some help after all.",
    "I have a fair amount of bait left over since last time I collected some, but I will be needing more shortly.",
    "Patience. I have kept the nature of the Karambwan a closely guarded secret. There is nobody alive who knows more about them than I do. Furthermore, there is nobody alive who even knows how they feed.",
    "You must therefore understand that what I am about to tell you is given in complete trust, and that you are to tell nobody else.",
    "Very well. The Karambwan are a form of octopus native to our island of Karamja. They feed solely on Karambwanji, a brightly coloured fish which also inhabits the coastal waters surrounding the island.",
    "Karambwanji congregate in coastal shoals near the Holy Lake. You will find it easiest to fish for them there.",
    "Just to the south of Tai Bwo Wannai Village. I'm sure you've met the locals already.",
    "Any small net will do. Return here as soon as you have caught 20 Karambwanji.",
    "How dare you say such a thing! Be off with you!",
    "Meaningless? You know nothing of the Karambwan! Now leave!",
    "I didn't for one moment think you did.",
    "A species of octopus native to the island which I and I alone know how to catch.",
    "I eat what I need and sell the rest to the Shrimp and Parrot restaurant.",
    "You don't know anything do you? Just north of here. In Brimhaven!",
    "That is part of the secret! Why would I tell you?",
    "That depends entirely on how it is cooked...",
    "Novicely cooked Karambwan is often poisonous to large mammals such as humans. If you buy some and cook it, be careful.",
    "Well you've wasted your time. My soul is long gone, along with my compassion.",
    "And I'm from the island Karamja. What do you want?",
    "Erm ... no.",
    "Funny you should say that...",
    "Well, people have been asking me for monkey skins all day!",
    "But no, I'm out of monkey skin.",
    "You will want to ask one of the warriors wandering in the jungle. I don't usually talk about it.",
    "Don't hurry back!",
    "Have you retrieved the Karambwanji yet?",
    "Thank you! This should tide me over for the next month.",
    "A species of octopus native to the island which I and I alone know how to catch.",
    "You should really ought to know that by now.",
    "I eat what I need and sell the rest to the Shrimp and Parrot restaurant. Before you ask, the Shrimp and Parrot is just north of here, in Brimhaven.",
    "My, you're keen aren't you?",
    "How would you feel about becoming my apprentice?",
    "As much as I need to protect the secret, I should not carry it to the grave.",
    "You seem a trustworthy type of person. Do you want to train as my apprentice?",
    "I'm glad to hear it. I'm sure the secrets of the Karambwan will be safe with you.",
    "In our language, Karambwan literally means 'Friend of Karamja.' As a friend of mine I will now show you how to fish for them. There are two aspects to fishing for Karambwan. Firstly, you must have the correct bait. Secondly, you must have the correct equipment. You already know of the Karambwanji, which shoal in the Holy Lake to the south. As I have explained, the Karambwan feed only on the Karambwanji, which are therefore the perfect bait.",
    "It is futile to attempt to catch Karambwan with something as basic as a net. They are too strong and vicious to be caught in such a fashion. I have spent many years designing a specially shaped vessel, into which Karambwan may pass but from which they may not return. If this vessel is loaded with Karambwanji, and then repeatedly lowered into a Karambwan shoal, then you should shortly find a Karambwan octopus trapped inside. I will now give you a Karambwan fishing vessel with which you can practise. Make sure you do not lose it. Under no circumstance may you give or show this to anybody. Do you understand?",
    "Feel free to practise on my fishing spot.",
    "Well ... since you ask, a specially constructed octopus pot. But don't tell anybody \u2013 that's part of the secret!",
    "Ah ... you again. Have you changed your mind yet? Do you want to train as my apprentice?",
    "Well the offer remains open. You're the most trustworthy lass I have met in a long time. Let me know if you change your mind.",
    "How fares my apprentice?",
    "And I'm glad to hear it!",
    "Look at you \u2013 outgrowing your boots already!",
    "You did what!? I hope nobody else has seen it...",
    "Well you'd better hope for your sake that this shark is never caught!",
    "In the meantime, you can practice with this.",
    "Don't mention it. I mean that.",
    "Well you'd better hope for your sake that this Karambwan is never caught!",
    "Well you'd better hope for your sake that it never floats back!",
    "Why?",
    "Living the hard life of a fisherman now, eh."
