    "How go your preparations?",
    "Do you want me to lead Captain Rovin and his scouts to Paterdomus?",
    "King Roald sent me to talk to you. Aeonisig is on his way. Have you two figured out anything we can do to strengthen the Salve?",
    "This isn't looking good. Keep thinking - I'll go see if Aeonisig has arrived. No doubt he'll need help with something.",
    "Perhaps. I'll first need a weapon that's effective against vyres. Sunspear, perhaps, or another weapon made of blisterwood.",
    "Think about how the humans that live there feel.",
    "Alright, you don't have to shout it in my face.",
    "That's the last of them...for now. I should check on Aeonisig.",
    "We need to establish a fortified position until reinforcements arrive.",
    "It's still occupied by Zamorakian monks.",
    "Anything else?",
    "It doesn't work. You saw that.",
    "'Shore it up?",
    "I can see if Drezel and Ivan have thought of anything yet.",
    "Anything else?",
    "What about Captain Rovin? I had to deal with those vyres because they're not equipped for it.",
    "That's the lower floors cleared. Now to check out the top floor of the temple.",
    "You'll what?",
    "What is it with you conspirators? What are you up to?",
    "That's the last of them. I'd best report back to Aeonisig.",
    "Aeonisig said you need some better armaments for fighting vampyres.",
    "Steel? Why not something stronger?",
    "Points made. Steel it is. What exactly do you need?",
    "Blisterwood weapons are the most effective, but there's no way I'd have time to equip the whole of Varrock's army.",
    "Aeonisig really needs us to figure something out down here - a scouting party of vyres just attacked us across the Salve! Vanescula's army can't be far behind.",
    "Your faith alone won't protect us here, Drezel. We can't rely on gods to save us.",
    "Surely, it can't hurt for us to read this book.",
    "Not yet.",
    "Yes - it's seemingly an account of how the barrier was first created, written by Ivandis Seergaze.",
    "He suggests that the seven warriors created the barrier from a blood ritual passed to them by Saradomin.",
    "It's the only lead we have - if it is a lie, then we'll find out, but if it's truth it might be what we need.",
    "Unfortunately, the details of the ritual have been left out, though there are some pages missing at the end of the book. It ends with Ivandis starting his journey into Morytania. We have no idea what he did next, but we do know where his body ended up.",
    "I'll go back there, and see if I can find a way to open his tomb.",
    "Yes, and among some other documents that I should probably read, I found a recipe for a more potent version of his Guthix balance potion.",
    "It details his struggle with what sounds like vampyrism, and his efforts to discover a way to reverse it. From what I can make out, he created the Guthix balance potion. There are also notes for how to create a more potent version, but I haven't done so yet...",
    "I should show this potion to Drezel and Ivan in the Paterdomus mausoleum.",
    "I've made what Ivandis referred to as a super Guthix balance potion. It was intended to be a way for Ivandis to, um, cure himself...of vampyrism.",
    "Look, it doesn't matter if it's true or not, but this potion might help us.",
    "And we fixed the River Salve by soaking up the corruption with rune essence. Good idea. I'll pour this potion in the well, and that should introduce the cure to the Salve.",
    "I've strengthened the Salve barrier. I hope. I should report back to Aeonisig.",
    "I've discovered a more potent recipe for the Guthix balance potion that should have, er, done something to the Salve. We're not sure exactly what, but it should at least slow down Vanescula's advance.",
    "Paterdomus temple is no longer occupied.",
    "No, they teleported away again.",
    "Remember that splinter group I reported to the king? Well, they're back.",
    "I'll deal with them in my own way.",
    "I've equipped the Varrock guards.",
    "I've completed those three tasks.",
    "She's alone?",
    "Even if he can, I'm not sure how much good that would do.",
    "No, but his army is prepared to fight should you try to cross the Salve.",
    "They'll be here soon enough. If you turn back now, we can avoid a war.",
    "Don't you mean loss of life?",
    "King Roald won't allow his citizens to become a buffet...he will put up a fight, there will be blood.",
    "You were foolish to come alone. How about I just kill you, here and now?",
    "Please, you don't have to do this. Spare Misthalin. There must be another way.",
    "Your word is worthless! You betrayed the Myreque. You murdered Safalaan!",
    "You expect me to believe that Safalaan wanted this?",
    "Look, I'm inclined to believe your intentions, but the people of Misthalin aren't going to take your word for it.",
    "They see you as invaders, and they will defend themselves. If you truly believe this is the only way, at least talk to King Roald first.",
    "I don't believe that. You'd just end up subjugating the people of Misthalin in their stead.",
    "He doesn't see it that way.",
    "That's a lot of vyres...",
    "Seems I'm doing a pretty good job of that so far.",
    "Is Drezel dead?",
    "Who are you? Where did you come from? And what was that thing?",
    "Is Drezel dead?",
    "Goodbye, Drezel. Rest in peace.",
    "Do you believe Vanescula would keep the peace, that all of her vyres would?",
    "I'll seek out Efaritay and see if I can help. If nothing else, it might get her on side to help us.",
    "Who are you?",
    "What purpose do you serve?",
    "How did you become Roald's advisor?",
    "Farewell",
    "Talk about River of Blood.",
    "Aren't you? I thought you were a king that led from the front lines?",
    "Talk about the beacons.",
    "Ask about the kingdom.",
    "Greet the king.",
    "Um, Efaritay. I'm sorry to interrupt, but we could still use your help.",
    "Imprisoned by Lord Drakan? That was you in the prisons on Vampyrium, wasn't it? Why wouldn't you leave with us?",
    "Your son is Safalaan, yes? He was with us that day. He helped me to kill Drakan.",
    "Drakan's sister, Vanescula. She was helping us to depose her brother, but as soon as we'd defeated Drakan, she turned on us. Vanescula bit Safalaan. She killed him.",
    "Wait? We did find a pendant here, in that crypt. Safalaan was wearing it.",
    "I don't understand. Why would your pendant be back here?",
    "Vanescula said something back at the bridge. I dismisses it before, but she suggested Safalaan was a willing participant.",
    "I saw the bite, he collapsed, and he didn't appear to be breathing, but...then Vanescula teleported away with his body.",
    "But Vanescula took him to use his blood to make her army immune to the Salve's wards. Surely that's not something he'd survive, even if the bite didn't kill him?",
    "Agreed to what?",
    "What? That thing that attacked us at the Salve - you're not suggesting THAT was Safalaan? No way. He'd never attack us like that.",
    "Ivan? Yes, he was a Myreque too. A survivor of Drakan's hunt.",
    "Drakan broke the spear in my fight with him. I was only able to retrieve the spear's blade.",
    "I'll help, if you can tell me what I need to do.",
    "Hmm, I'll see what I can do.",
    "So I need the Sunspear blade I took from Lord Drakan, a new blisterwood shaft and a twin-bladed silver spike?",
    "I kept Sunspear's blade, but lost it. Ivan should be holding on to it for me.",
    "I have Sunspear with me... Well, the blade at least.",
    "I have Sunspear's blade in storage. I'll go retrieve it.",
    "How would I go about crafting a new blisterwood spear shaft?",
    "I've crafted a new spear shaft out of blisterwood - I hope it will suffice.",
    "And then you said something about a twin-bladed silver spike? That sounds familiar to me - it doesn't happen to affect werewolves by any chance, does it?",
    "One better - I used to own a wolfbane dagger. Drezel gave it to me. I imagine he or Ivan is looking after it.",
    "One better - I think I have it with me. It is a wolfbane dagger.",
    "One better - I think I own one. Drezel refers to it as a wolfbane dagger.",
    "Here - I have the reforged Sunspear with me.",
    "Where should I start in tracking down the wyrd?",
    "Vanescula told it to return to the castle, but if she meant Castle Drakan, I can't see how I'd gain access, even with my disguise.",
    "Not anything specific. I know it's possible, but have no idea where or how it's done. All of the Myreque that operated in Meiyerditch are either dead or missing.",
    "Again, I don't know much. There's an abandoned laboratory beneath the city where I once found a book on the subject, but I couldn't understand a word of it.",
    "Not yet. I'll see what I can find.",
    "Sarius? What are you doing here?",
    "Only a few of us got out - myself, Ivan and Veliaf. Veliaf has given up, and Ivan's gone back to Paterdomus.",
    "I think there's probably plenty of blame to go around. Safalaan was reckless too, and Vanescula played us all. You weren't to know she'd betray us.",
    "She bit him, and now I suspect she's turned him too, but if so he's not like any vyre we've ever faced.",
    "To see if I missed anything about haemalchemy...some clue about how people are turned into vyres. Now I think of it, how did you find this place?",
    "The problem is, I've already thoroughly searched this place. The only thing I found was a book on haemalchemy, and that was just sitting out in the open.",
    "I found an old acquaintance there, oddly - the daughter of the man who used to work in that lab.",
    "Hey, I think I found something. It's marked with the same symbol from the haemalchemy book.",
    "I discovered a well-hidden journal written by Sarius's father.",
    "Um, I don't know, I haven't read it.",
    "The journal Sarius and I discovered talked about haemalchemy. Her father, Mauritys was coerced by Drakan to experiment with it. It was he who discovered a way to vampyrise other species in laboratory conditions, but he continued other work in secret, and it sounds like he found a way to reverse the process entirely...",
    "I'm not sure I'd call vampyrism a disease, but effectively, yes. We already know of some ways to undo the process in its earlier stages. The Guthix balance potion can sometimes turn juvinates back into humans, and the super version is more consistent, but always turns them feral. It makes sense there'd be a more refined method, and it appears Mauritys discovered one a long time ago... at least in theory.",
    "It suggests using the key ingredient of the other Guthix balance potion, but with two different ingredients to enhance it. Those being refined daeyalt and what the journal refers to as 'the blood of the hybrid', a creature he only theorised about.",
    "Well, there is a mine in the heart of Meiyerditch, a work camp for humans that refuse to pay tithers, but that's only daeyalt ore. We need refined daeyalt. Mauritys's journal says that refined daeyalt is used in the vampyrification process, so there must be a refinery down there somewhere too.",
    "Mauritys's journal doesn't name a specific creature, only something theoretically possible according to his research. His premise was that blood that has been altered via haemalchemy is always trying to revert back to its natural state. Refined daeyalt's role in vampyrification is to bond a subject's own blood with vampyric blood. The theory was that using the blood of a creature that embodied all possible states would catalyse a subject's rejection of non-natural states.",
    "I discovered a journal in the tunnels!",
    "Oh, I don't know. I haven't read it yet...",
    "I found this journal written by your father. It suggests he wrote this after the laboratory was destroyed.",
    "His notes theorise about a way to revert vampyrism! It's why Drakan had this place destroyed.",
    "The only problem is that it's only a theory. He suggests two ingredients necessary for a 'cure'. The first is refined daeyalt, itself a key ingredient in turning other species into vyres - it acts as some sort of catalyst for change.",
    "The problem is the other ingredient. He calls it the 'blood of the hybrid', a theorised creature that has traits of many different species. He suggested such blood would allow for the creation of a universal cure.",
    "If that wyrd is Safalaan, its blood could be the key. It's worth a shot.",
    "Well, for now maybe I should just try to find some refined daeyalt. There must be a refinery connected to the daeyalt mine, right?",
    "There isn't much down there, save for a tunnel where loaded mine carts are taken.",
    "What, even to Vanescula's personal tithe?",
    "Where does it look like? Into the mine, of course. I'm sure I don't need to remind you that I'm Vanescula's personal tithe...",
    "Well, I suppose I could just tell Vanescula that you tithed me instead of sending me to the mines, right? I'm sure she'd understand.",
    "How do I reach the refinery from here?",
    "How do I reach the refinery from here?",
    "I've done that already.",
    "How do I reach the refinery from here?",
    "House Ghrazi prefer the taste of aggression.",
    "House Vitur prefer the taste of awe.",
    "House Pyrah prefer the taste of disapproval.",
    "House Myrmel prefer the taste of remorse.",
    "House Drakan prefer the taste of hope.",
    "House Shadum prefer the taste of submission.",
    "I've shut down the refinery. Now I can get the refined daeyalt.",
    "I have the refined daeyalt. Now all I need is the blood of the hybrid.",
    "Yes - the layout reminds me of the prisons in Drakan's castle on Vampyrium.",
    "Yes, and some refined daeyalt! Also, I think the wyrd is in there too, in some sort of rejuvenation chamber.",
    "Probably, but I need to find a way to open it first.",
    "Safalaan, is it you?",
    "Wha- I don't feel so good. Must find Safalaan. His blood...",
    "It was the wyrd in that tank. It slashed me with its talons and...I don't feel so good.",
    "Safalaan held back, though - it wasn't a lethal dose. I need to head back to the castle to chase him down.",
    "I don't feel right...at all.",
    "Safalaan, wait. I know it's you.",
    "I can't do that. You're my friend.",
    "You need my help, and I need yours. Please, wait!",
    "I don't feel right...at all. I... What-What's wrong with me...?",
    "My... lord? I don't... understand. Why am I answering him? Lord Drakan is dead.",
    "I... Wha-What's wrong with me...?",
    "Kael?!",
    "Andiess...",
    "I can get to the roof now.",
    "He's not completely gone, and we can bring him back. You just need to trust me.",
    "I can take that away. All I need is a little of your blood.",
    "Wait, Safalaan, stop! That's Efaritay. That's your mother!",
    "Let's hope Safalaan's wyrd blood is this 'blood of the hybrid' Mauritys theorised.",
    "Safalaan, I'm going to need just a small sample of your blood.",
    "If I mix some refined daeyalt into Safalaan's blood, along with some of Ivandis's serum, that should create a potion to counteract vampyrism.",
    "I've lost Ivandis's serum.",
    "I found it in the tomb of Ivandis Seergaze.",
    "(Same as above)",
    "I should talk to Efaritay first, then take it to Paterdomus mausoleum. I can reclaim this from Efaritay if I lose it.",
    "So, you know that potion I just made?",
    "I've lost it.",
    "Here, Safalaan, take some of this potion...",
    "How do you feel?",
    "Well, that bodes well. Hopefully, this potion will work better than the last one...",
    "I'm glad I could help. Now I have this presumed cure, I should return to Paterdomus with it to see if it actually works.",
    "I've managed to make an even more potent version of a Guthix balance potion - this one should reliably convert vampyres back into their original form, not turn them feral.",
    "Don't fall apart now, Ivan. I need you to perform the ritual.",
    "Are you so sure about that?",
    "It's over, Vanescula. Stand down. We can talk this over peacefully.",
    "Vanescula, stop! See reason. Your army is falling apart before you.",
    "Build your society of humans and vampyres here, Vanescula.",
    "What has this got to do with me?",
    "I'm happy to report that Vanescula has retreated her army back to Darkmeyer. A formative alliance is in effect.",
    "It's better than them fighting, killing and eating each other.",
    "I'm sure he enjoyed that news.",
    "How are you finding your new role as an ambassador for Varrock?",
    "Perhaps it will give you a new perspective on the issues Morytania now faces.",
    "I'll keep that in mind. Thank you, Queen Efaritay.",
    "I still can't believe you agreed to this, to being turned into the very thing we were fighting.",
    "It sounds like you've got a lot ahead of you. I hope you can make this alliance work.",
    "So, er, how goes the truce?",
    "So, it's good, then?",
    "How is the vyre population responding to all of this?",
    "Well, okay then.",
    "Why are all the vyres here still shocked to see a human? Why do I still need a disguise?",
    "Can't you just tell them to, you know, stop attacking humans?",
    "Are you suggesting you can't control them or that you won't?",
    "So, none then?",
    "Veliaf, you should know - Safalaan is sort of back. He's, er, still a vampyre, but he's just like his old self. I discovered a serum that diminishes vampyric bloodlust.",
    "He's helping to oversee bringing peace to Meiyerditch and Darkmeyer, with the help of Efaritay, Aeonisig and Vanescula.",
    "Wait, you're not going to try to kill her are you? The peace we've brokered is quite new and fragile.",
    "Phew! Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.",
    "You seem to be a bit more cheerful.",
    "How are the citizens of Meiyerditch taking to this new...arrangement?",
    "It sounds like you've a lot on your plate. Good luck with it all.",
    "Why not?",
    "Really?",
    "You're more than welcome.",
    "Hi, how are things in Meiyerditch now?",
    "Do you know much about the new leaders?",
    "The truth is somewhere between all of those things.",
    "Hello there.",
    "What is this place?",
    "How are you doing?",
    "What's that awful smell?",
    "How long have you been here?",
    "Okay, thanks.",
    "How goes things, Ivan?",
    "I think he's as overwhelmed as you are, but I get the impression he's going to be fine. He's certainly got plenty of support, what with Vanescula and Efaritay...and Aeonisig too, for whatever that's worth.",
    "Vampyres aren't undead. They're living creatures, originally from Vampyrium. It's a common misconception. Regardless, you're welcome. Any news on where Zemouregal and Arrav went?",
    "For now, at least. The brokered peace may not hold.",
    "Such as?"

  "King Roald": [
    "How indeed. Have troops been sent to Paterdomus yet, Aeonisig?",
    "Good man! Then let's get to it, shall we? What do you say, Player?",
    "Splendid.",
    "No, I need you to visit the temple's caretakers and see how you can help them. Aeonisig here will be my eyes on the frontline - pack your bags, you're going on a little field trip.",
    "You're going, and that's final, unless you wish to start advising my wife on delphiniums?",
    "I need to be here to oversee preparations for the army. When I arrive, I expect a FULL report this time - do you understand?",
    "Now, please, Player, go ahead and meet with Drezel and your friend. Aeonisig shall join you there shortly, at the old watchtower by the start of the beacon network.",
    "Do not let me down now, Player. Your expertise in this matter is required.",
    "Do not let me down now, Player. Your expertise in this matter is required.",
    "How things come full circle, Player. It seems barely any time ago at all that I first asked you to visit with Drezel, and now look at where we are.",
    "Aren't you supposed to be doing something in Morytania about now?",
    "Mind your tone. My fighting days are behind me. It takes a lot of work to raise an army. I'm well aware of the situation on the front lines. I'm trying to garner military support from our allies, but they're all busy dealing with their own issues. I fear only the return of the gods themselves would bring us all together. For now, Varrock stands alone. Besides, the wife won't let me go. If you think an army of blood-suckers is scary, try being married to her!",
    "Do you have a report from the front lines?",
    "So my scouts inform me. I'm not quite sure how I feel about this alliance - humans, vampyres and now an icyene all working together.",
    "And not invading my kingdom too. Still, we shall have to keep a close eye on how this develops. To that end, I have ordered Aeonisig to act as an ambassador for Misthalin.",
    "He shall be my eyes and ears in Morytania, or Hallowvale, or whatever they end up deciding to call that place this time.",
    "We've had words. He was starting to presume too much about his position - 'king's advisor in spiritual matters'. As if I don't get my ear bent enough by my wife.",
    "Anyway, as I understand it, you were once again pivotal to the events of the day. As such, it is only right to reward you for your efforts...",
    "Varrock has survived many attacks since its founding, but I'm thankful this vampyre situation was resolved peacefully.",
    "And if it doesn't, we shall deal with the situation. I am taking steps that, should it not hold, Varrock will be in a much stronger position to deal with it. For example, Aeonisig is offering aid to the citizens of Meiyerditch in exchange for shipments of blisterwood. Truth be told, my worries have moved on to other matters. If it's not one thing, it's another, so they say.",
    "It appears that your intervention at the Salve targets only vampyres. Werewolves, on the other hand, are free to cross. The reports state that they have effectively declared independence from the vampyres. We shall need to keep a close watch on what they do with this newfound freedom."

    "Captain Rovin has a small scouting force ready for travel, my liege.",
    "M-my liege? You want ME to go to Paterdomus? B-but I'm of more use to you here. I'm not a soldier.",
    "I... No, of course not, my liege. I'll inform Captain Rovin.",
    "Y-yes, my liege. I understand.",

    "No, vampyres! Behind you!",
    "Vyres! West of the Salve! This is awful! This is a disaster!",
    "Yes, I admit, I didn't take you seriously.\u00a0But this threat! All of Misthalin is in danger! If those were scouts, then Vanescula will be here soon. The five of us will\u00a0not be able to face a whole army. We must do something. We can't just wait here to die.",
    "What about Paterdomus? Could we use the temple as a base?",
    "Yes, of course. Maybe you should clear them out of there.",
    "Well, uh, what about the Salve barrier?",
    "Yes, but couldn't you, I don't know, shore it up or something?",
    "Yes. You know, nail a few metaphorical boards over the windows.",
    "Yes, good idea.",
    "Not that I can think of.",
    "Good idea! See what you can do to help them.",
    "Talk to Drezel and Ivan in the Paterdomus mausoleum. Stregthen that barrier, no matter the cost.",
    "We need to reclaim the temple of Paterdomus to use as our base of operations. It's currently occupied by blasphemous monks of Zamorak. I doubt they'll leave without...encouragement.",
    "Good.",
    "Whatever it takes.",
    "A naive sentiment. We don't have time for negotiation, and I doubt they'll be in any mood to listen.",
    "The Varrock guard aren't well equipped to fight vampyres. Captain Rovin could use your aid.",
    "Talk to Drezel and Ivan in the Paterdomus mausoleum. Stregthen that barrier, no matter the cost.",
    "I'm not sure why you're talking to me about this. You're supposed to be helping Drezel to strengthen the Salve barrier.",

    "Yes, now apply that pragmatism to Vanescula. (Continues below)",
    "Remind me not to make an enemy of you. (Continues below)",

    "A shame. Never mind, we have more pressing concerns.",
    "We've enough to worry about with a vampyre army on its way. We don't have time to question them, just get rid of them! If we manage to survive a vampyric invasion, then we can investigate those little warmongers.",
    "Hopefully, they should be able to fend off any further scouting parties.",
    "And not a moment too soon. Rovin has spied Vanescula's arrival at the bridge over the Salve.",

    "Well, you do know each other. Clearly, she won't listen to you, but it might stall her for a time. (Continues below)",
    "If you think it would be that easy, then by all means go and confront her. (Continues below)",
    "Indeed, yes, you should do this. I'll keep watch from the overlook. (Continues below)",
    "Regardless, I shall have the beacons lit to inform the king that her army has arrived. I do hope he can muster something of an army of our own in response...",
    "I don't need King Roald to tell me that peaceful resolution here is not an option! You would expect us to believe our citizens have nothing to fear from this army before us?",
    "She is a monster, boy! Don't be taken in by her words - all she desires is the blood of our citizens! We should kill them all.",

    "He is said to have created this barrier. Although separated from us, surely he could do so again. I...",
    "I had hoped it would not come to this...but there is one book that might help. But it is a forbidden tome. Some even consider it heretical.",
    "Because it surely cannot help but give us false hope. Only Saradomin can aid us now.",
    "No, I suppose not. The book is hidden away in Paterdomus library...locked away where it belongs. My predecessor dismissed it as Zamorakian propaganda, and I've no reason to disagree. Retrieving the hidden book had something to do with where each of the Seven Priestly Warriors came from, used in a specific order. The Sleeping Seven book should help...",
    "Like I said, it's blasphemy. It can't be the truth. It's clearly Zamorakian propaganda.",
    "This feels wrong - to commit such sacrilege on the basis of reading a clearly false text.",
    "That could be just the solution we need! Gather the ingredients and make the potion.",
    "This is all nonsense, of course. Ivandis was a hero.",
    "There is something we could try. It is possible to alter the effect the Salver barrier has. If you recall, the Zamorakians attempted a similar thing by corrupting it.",
    "We may as well try this potion, seeing how vampyres can now cross. At least we might have some say in what happens to them when they do.",
    "You should see what more you can do for Aeonisig while Ivan and I prepare for the arrival of Vanescula's army.",

    "Um, but shouldn't we be certain and ask the king? Shouldn't he be here by now? Vanescula is-",
    "You may be able to cross, but we've altered the Salve barrier. If you truly care for the vyres, then you'll stay on your side of the river.",

    "Drezel, no!",

    "No, but he's severely wounded, and I think that wyrd did something to him. Some sort of poison, maybe?",
    "He hasn't been making sense for a while. The wyrd's poison is making him see things.",
    "What? No! Stay with me, Drezel. I need you. I'm not ready.",
    "He's gone. Drezel is dead. Perhaps Efaritay is right. Maybe we should just let the vyres pass. If we fight them, there'd be so much death.",
    "Despite everything that's happened, she still makes a lot of sense, and I could almost believe that she'd at least try to keep her word. But that thing with the wyrd - it's clear she can't control them all. Their lust for blood is just too strong. It's an impossible choice - either way, they'd be bringing a lot of death to Misthalin. Yet, in spite of the fact that Vanescula's army is sat on our doorstep, that wyrd is what I'm most afraid of. It came right for me, and what it said... Something tells me that's more important to deal with than Vanescula right now. Even she couldn't control it.",

    "You have forced us to defend ourselves, Vanescula. You did this. Send as many vyres across as you wish!",
    "You have always been genuine, even when we doubted you. I believe that we can all live together, somehow.",
    "Thank you once again, my friend. I don't know what we'd have done without you. Nor King Roald, for that matter! You deserve a big reward.",

    "You've not served in many armies have you? The time and money it would take to outfit an entire army with anything more than steel is immense. Besides, I certainly don't want to talk to the king about increasing our military budget, and I doubt Vanescula will delay the start of her war just to reduce my stress levels.",
    "Make it a platebody, platelegs and a medium helm - three of each should cover my advance guard. As for weapons, what do you recommend? These silver-edged weapons from our stores seem woefully inadequate. We were able to get a lucky hit in here or there while those vyres were focussed on you, but that's it.",
    "Could you at least get some to us? Personally, I'd favour a polearm, and my two scouts here could each use a sickle. that's the Myreque symbol, right? It might lift spirits for the other soldiers to see that.",
    "Thanks for the assist, Player. We feel less like sitting ducks here now. You can tell that bureaucrat we're sorted. And you should know, my scouts say they spotted an absolutely huge vampyre out there - big claws, purple fur, bestial. I think their fear is making them see things, but I thought you should know.",
    "Next time those vyres attack, we'll be ready for them!",
    "Stand ready, soldiers. The next vyre attack could come at any time.",
    "First you helped us defeat Zemouregal's zombie army, and now you've saved all of Misthalin from invasion by Morytanian bloodsuckers. You're a veritable scourge of the undead.",

    "We invited him and his family to our camp to discuss reparations. We prepared a meal. We prepared riches. Such was the custom.",
    "But when he arrived, Lord Jovkai had brought his own banquet. He sat at the head of our table, and beckoned us to sit. Meals were placed in front of us.",
    "I looked around at my brothers. We ate without joy. I could eat nothing.",
    "Lord Jovkai watched us. He asked if we were enjoying the meal. My brothers nodded in agreement, but I remained silent.",
    "Then he filled his cup with wine again and stood up. He told us that this was it: this was to be our reparations. We would be strangers in our own home, dining from his scraps.",
    "He walked over to me, placing the cup in front of me and forced me to drink it. I had to; his blade was at my back.",
    "Once the meal was finished, Lord Jovkai made me wash the plates, like some disobedient child. Vanescula Drakan, tending to tables.",

    "I am sorry for before, at the bridge. I have been imprisoned by Lord Drakan for so long, to avoid war, and to see opposing armies upon my return angered me.",
    "Drakan held my family hostage. I dared not risk them, but his death freed me. And yet I return here to find his word was meaningless. My husband is dead and my son is gone. I know not where.",
    "Safalaan was there? I didn't... What happened to him?",
    "If only he'd discovered my old pendant here, it would have protected Safalaan from her.",
    "And yet somehow my pendant's found it's way back here? how strange. Could you retrieve the pendant for me, please?",
    "Someone must have returned it. You said Safalaan was wearing it. If that were true, Vanescula would not have been able to bite him. Not unless he stopped wearing it, but why would he have?",
    "Wait, did you actually see my son die?",
    "Then Safalaan may still be alive! It would take more than a single bite to kill him, and someone returned that pendant here.",
    "Not unless...no, she wouldn't have, not to my son! He'd never have agreed to it!",
    "If...if she'd...turned him. He could have given up his own blood and fed on others to heal...but that could mean that wyrd was...",
    "Drakan mocked me for years about his experiments with an offshoot of blood magic called haemalchemy. He threatened to turn my husband and son into vyres on a number of occasions. Over time, it was clear that Drakan learned to regret those experiments. The advent of wyrds was one such cause for that regret. It must be why he spared Safalaan...though not my husband. Wyrds are rare occurrences, so he told me, only created when someone with icyene heritage was turned. The closer to icyene a subject was, the larger and stronger the wyrd, and the greater its contempt for the pious, and for creatures of light. It would be why the wyrd went after those monks. Did Safalaan have some connection with the boy?",
    "I need to be sure - would you help me to track down this wyrd? If it is Safalaan, perhaps I can get through to it. And if I cannot, I could do with your assistance in reclaiming my old weapon, Sunspear. Drakan stole it from me; I'm hoping that you kept it upon defeating him.",
    "I forged that spear myself from the first blisterwood tree planted here, but barely got to use it. When Drakan's attack came, we were caught off guard. My seat of power was the castle north of here; Drakan tunnelled into it from what is now this graveyard. We'd been led to believe vampyres were nothing but feral beasts, but they are clever and cruel. Before we could mount a defence, my family was in his grasp. My surrender was selfish and swift. I should have fought back, but I was afraid. From that day, he carried my own weapon as a symbol of my submission. Some of the icyene most loyal to me tried to mount an early resistance, but ended up here, struck down by the very weapon I created to protect them.",
    "I'd like to fully reforge the spear, if we could. Please, bring me the blade. We'll also require a new blisterwood shaft. There was one final component, however, which may be more difficult to track down. Drakan removed the twin-bladed silver spike.",
    "It should be simple enough if you are able to obtain some blisterwood logs. Simply craft them as you might make any other blisterwood weapon, except this time make a spear shaft.",
    "Yes! It suppressed their ability to change form. You know of it?",
    "Please, once you have the blade, the blisterwood shaft and a silver spike, reforge the spear and bring it to me.",
    "Drakan tainted this weapon with the blood of my brethren, but you have made it anew. Thank you for restoring Sunspear to its former glory. I find it fitting that you should continue to wield it against the darkness of Morytania. It has already done more good in your hands that it ever did in mine. I shall bind it to the young priest, Ivan Strom, for you to reclaim should you lose it.",
    "I'm not sure. I wounded it back at the river; I suspect it fled to heal itself.",
    "Then we should try another approach. Wyrds are created through a process of vampyrification - do you know anything of this?",
    "Then what do you know of haemalchemy? Perhaps it can provide some clue for how to track the wyrd.",
    "It doesn't sound like much to go on, but should there perhaps be something in this haemalchemy laboratory that you missed?",
    "Did you find anything in the haemalchemy lab?",
    "Did you find anything in the haemalchemy lab?",
    "I wonder if she can help you discover anything more about haemalchemy.",
    "Did you find anything in the haemalchemy lab?",
    "Did it help at all with our search or was it only personal?",
    "Did you find anything in the haemalchemy lab?",
    "You mean there's a cure?",
    "It would explain why Drakan turned away from vampyrising other species, and no doubt strengthened his resolve to return to simpler times for his own kind. Did this same journal suggest how we might replicate this 'cure'?",
    "Do you know somewhere to obtain refined daeyalt?",
    "This daeyalt mine sounds like somewhere you should investigate further.",
    "What is the blood of the hybrid?",
    "If this wyrd really is Safalaan, then his blood could be the key to a cure.",
    "Have you discovered anything in the daeyalt mine?",
    "Presumably this mine is guarded, yes? I'm sure they would know about a refinery down there.",
    "Have you found a daeyalt refinery?",
    "Is it Safalaan? Should I come to help?",
    "Very well. I'll head to the castle and join you soon.",
    "The poison of the wyrd is said to cause hallucinations, before death. It must be quite debilitating.",
    "If you can corner him on the roof, I'll help trap him there so he doesn't escape.",
    "I won't let you go again, son. We're here to help you.",
    "Stop, son.",
    "Be calm. We're going to help you find yourself.",
    "Well, where did you find it? You'll have to return there to see if there's any more.",
    "Yes?",
    "Then it's lucky for the thousands of vyres and humans that might otherwise die that I found it.",
    "Thank you for helping me to find my son again. We have much healing to do, but he is responding well.",
    "We shall join you there when we can. For the time being, however, I must tend to my son.",
    "Listen to my son, Lady Vanescula. You are not like your brother, Lowerniel. There is light in you. Even I can sense that.",
    "No! There has been enough blood shed in these lands. These are NOT your lands.",
    "I make no claim over them, but they can be shared.",
    "You can only rise against your enemies, Vanescula. It's not going to be easy, but you don't strike me as the type to give in so readily.",
    "What say you, king's advisor? If you still wish for war, then you'll have to go through me. By all means, strike me down; make an enemy of the icyene too. I'm sure Saradomin would understand.",
    "Good man. Now, Lady Vanescula, we have much to discuss...",
    "Things have been such a whirlwind since my escape that I have not had chance to thank you. You defeated Drakan and gave me back my freedom, you returned my son to me and you've been pivotal in bringing about this alliance. I am forever in your debt. Though I shall be needed here to advise Safalaan and help to rebuild this place, should you ever need my assistance you need only ask.",
    "No, still not queen. I dare not assume that mantle again. This is not the kingdom I used to rule. It is something new.",
    "Please, don't be too harsh on him. Icyene emotions often run hot. If he'd had a parent there to teach him these things when he was young, he might have had more control over himself. That is my fault.",
    "It will take much for the humans of this region to stop hating the vyres. Trust is further off still. My hope is to rebuild my old castle. If the citizens see that the queen of old has returned, it will help.",
    "She's a sharp one, isn't she? She's certainly a breath of fresh air, compared to her brother.",
    "You are not your brother. It's true I'd rather you hadn't turned my son into a vyre, but he's explained that the decision was his."

She'd be too proud to say anything, but if I had to guess, I think she's feeling remorse for whatever happened to Safalaan. What DID happen to him?",
    "Oh no! That must be why she's spending so much time in the castle basement. If you're trying to get into Castle Drakan, why have you come here?",
    "My father was separated from us for so long. We were only permitted to communicate via letter. Over time, Mauritys and I developed a way of coding information into his messages. It's how I knew to direct you to his letter about this laboratory in the first place.",
    "Ha! That sounds like my father, to leave something obvious to find, but to hide the true secrets. In one of his last messages to me, it was clear he feared for his life, and he knew this place was no longer safe. I doubt he'd have left anything truly valuable here, but I do know he was able to return to these tunnels even after they were abandoned. You should search throughout the tunnels here for any letters or books. If you find something written by my father, please could you bring it to show me?",
    "I suspect he might have hidden more crucial information deeper in the complex. You should search through the tunnels here. Keep an eye out for a clue or something out of place.",
    "You found something? What does it say?",
    "So he did survive? In his final letter to me he noted his fear that his work would be destroyed. If he didn't contact me again, he must have a good reason.",
    "Revert it? You mean all those turned humans could be brought back? Most of the vampyres in Morytania are vampyrised humans - this could change everything!",
    "I don't know about refined daeyalt, but the mines in northern Meiyerditch might be a good place to explore.",
    "Say, a vampyre that was once half-human, half-icyene?",
    "Vanescula must have been keeping him in the basement of Castle Drakan. That's all I know, and I'm sorry, but I can't get you into the castle.",

To them, this is still very much their home, and you are still an interloper. Many of them are still refusing to take the serum, but that will change in time, even if I have to force the issue.",
