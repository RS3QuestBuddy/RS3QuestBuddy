    "Thank Saradomin I found you! I believe you still have the magical sword Silverlight?",
    "There is an urgent task that only you can do - and only with Silverlight! My partner Badden and I have been observing the dark wizard Denath, who we believe has been preparing to summon the powerful demon Agrith Naar. A week ago he took a group of apprentice dark wizards and moved to Uzer, the lost city in the desert. We think he's going to use the city's ancient temple to summon the demon!",
    "Stop him? No! We want you to wait until Agrith Naar is summoned and then kill him once and for all! Let me explain. Agrith Naar is not an ordinary demon. He has immense magical powers, and he can use these powers to influence the mortal plane. This summoning is our chance to rid the world of his evil influence! You should go to Uzer and find Badden at once. I'll follow once I've finished some business here.",
    "Did you go to Uzer to see Badden?",
    "You must hurry!",
    "Phew! It's too hot for me out here. But at least I found my way through the desert!",
    "Oh dear no, you won't get me up in one of those things! What if the magic failed?",
    "But the rules of my order say I must wear them!",
    "Saradomin's rules are once and for all! It is not our place to question them!",
    "Summoning a demon! Those wizards make me sick! What kind of sad people would call on a supernatural being to solve their problems for them?",
    "What? No, that's totally different, because... um... because we always give thanks to Saradomin, even when he doesn't do anything! Not like those wizards! They're so full of themselves, with their fancy robes and their rituals!",
    "No, it's totally different! Anyway, there must be something wrong with the way they live in their little group and separate themselves from the rest of society. It can't be healthy.",
    "No, nothing like that. Wait, are you being sarcastic? Because you should know that sarcasm is specifically forbidden in the holy book of Saradomin!",
    "Shut up!",
    "What's happening? This sandstorm came out of nowhere!",
    "Oh no! What can we do?",
    "Oh! Oh dear! I don't think I could take part in a demonic ritual!",

    "They should have known better than to join Denath in his evil schemes!",
    "Well... all right.",
    "So Agrith Naar was trapped in our dimension all along, and didn't have any influence until the wizards un-summoned him? I thought slaying him would make the world better, but now we're fighting to return it to how it was before!",

    "Oh, don't be so simple-minded! You'll be summoning a demon in order to kill it, to rid the world of great evil!",
    "Now take this demonic sigil, and hurry inside!",
    "Denath was Agrith Naar all along! We've just sent him back to his own dimension!",
    "You've got to help me summon him again, so I can slay him with Silverlight!",

    "What brings you to this godsforsaken desert?",
    "Saradomin be praised! And you have Silverlight! You're willing to help us, then?",
    "Agrith Naar is not so much a demon as a force of nature. While he is in his own dimension his evil magics can reach everywhere in the world. No one knows how far his power extends, but Reen and I believe that much of the suffering in the world is due to him. The accident that cripples a man, the storm that sweeps a ship under the sea, the sudden fire in the blood that makes a wolf pack attack a town - all that is Agrith Naar!",
    "We've been keeping an eye on Denath for some years now, but we've never been able to move against him. He led the group that summoned Delrith, but left Varrock before we could apprehend him. He's been studying Agrith Naar for years, but when he brought his group here we knew he was about to make his move.",
    "I'm not sure. This city is very ancient, and its builders were powerful workers of evil magic. As that foul construct over there proves. Perhaps there's something here he needs. Do you know what happened here?",
    "The golem, yes! An abomination in the eyes of holy Saradomin! A mockery of life! Right now Denath is more important, but once he is dealt with I should find some way to destroy it.",
    "You opened a portal to a demon's realm? That must be why Denath is here! It would be much easier to reach Agrith Naar's realm from another demon's realm than from the mortal plane. Denath must have heard that the portal here was open and decided to make his move!",
    "You have to be in position to kill Agrith Naar as soon as he is summoned. The best way to do that is to infiltrate the group that is summoning him!",
    "I don't know. You'll have to find some way to convince them you're one of them.",
    "Oh, don't be so simple-minded! You'll be summoning a demon in order to kill it, to rid the world of great evil! You won't really be joining the group, just infiltrating it.",
    "Oh dear. I was hoping Player would arrive.",
    "How is it going?",
    "Oh dear. Do try again. You must be in place when they summon the demon!",
    "How is it going?",
    "I was sleeping last night. I'm only human after all! But I had this odd dream, about fear and panic, and... fire...",
    "What's happening? The wind suddenly picked up! It's a desert sandstorm!",
    "Saradomin protect us! From his own dimension he'll be able to wreak havoc!",
    "All right!",
    "Let's get this ritual over with! I don't want to spend any more time with that golem than I have to!",
    "Bah!",
    "So that's Agrith Naar's true form! Quickly, slay him with Silverlight!",

    "I do not know. I heard him say that Saradomin hates all artificial creatures. It was not always so. When I was new, the priests of Saradomin praised the ingenuity of the golem-builders. I paraded through the city with my siblings, all painted in bright colours, and they blessed us with holy water as we prepared for battle. He should know that I could never hurt him. The first command in a golem's mind is that it cannot allow a human being to come to harm.",
    "Some of them were curious about me when they arrived, but since then they have ignored me. As they passed me I felt a sense of dark foreboding, something I have not felt since the great enemy was nearby. I fear they are planning some great evil.",
    "It is good to see a friendly face here. The priest has said nothing to me but 'Get ye away, foul construct!'",
    "I saw one of the men in dark robes run out of the temple. He looked very frightened and I feared for his safety. He was carrying a large book. He started to head out into the desert, but then turned back and hid the book in one of the broken kilns in which my kind were created long ago. Then another man came out of the temple. He said magical words and threw a fireball at the first man, turning him to dust! I should have saved him, but I was not fast enough to throw myself in the path of the fireball.",
    "I cannot remember. The shock of seeing a human being killed wiped the details of the incident from my memory.",
    "I sensed a great darkness, as of a demon revelling in its moment of triumph. And now this sandstorm appears, the likes of which I have not seen in three thousand years. What can it mean?",
    "It is a terrible thing for a demon to be victorious. I wish there was something I could do to rectify the situation.",
    "I cannot do that. It is forbidden for a golem to enter the portal.",
    "A golem cannot disobey the commands in its mind!",
    "I do not know. I was not privy to the thoughts of my designers, and now they cannot be asked.",
    "That is true. Perhaps if you opened my head and removed the instruction concerning the portal I would be able to help you. But there must have been a reason why my builders imposed this restriction. I do not know what would happen to me if I went through the portal.",

To conjure these items is trivial for Agrith Naar. But you will not need such weapons or armour, for Agrith Naar will grant you the power of life and death over all creatures! You shall have every wish granted, and everyone who has ever wronged you will burn in a hell of your own devising!",
    "Right and wrong are for the weak! This is your chance to choose to be on the side of the strong, and have all your desires granted, while the weak are crushed beneath Agrith Naar's demonic feet!",

It is [Camerinthum Tarren Caldar Nahudu Agrith Naar]. You will also need to make yourself a demonic sigil to act as a focus of power. One of the group has the mould you need to make it. Now let me continue with my preparations!",

    "Hello. Are you Josef's replacement?",
    "It just goes to show how little Denath values us.",
    "Denath told us we would learn the secrets of demonic magic, but all we've done is memorize one incantation. And now he replaces poor Josef with the next person who comes along!",
    "No, I think Jennifer has it.",
    "Shh! Listen, Denath doesn't know this... When we joined him, Denath told us we were going to learn all the secrets of demonic magic, but we still don't know anything. The others, they just think they're terribly evil, with their sigils and the incantation they learned by rote. But Josef and I wanted more - we wanted to know how it worked. Josef was more curious than me. Last night, he secretly read a book that Denath was keeping from us. He didn't know I was awake, but I saw what happened. I saw him read it, and then his face turned white, and he took the book and ran through the portal. But Denath was waking up, and when he saw Josef was gone he went through the portal to look for him. A bit later Denath returned, without Josef or the book. Josef didn't have money for the magic carpet, and he can't have got far in the desert at night with that heavy book. Josef must have hidden the book somewhere in the ruins, before Denath followed him. If you could find it, we'd know what it was that frightened him. We'd know what Denath is really up to!",
    "Did you find that book?",
    "Did the golem see what happened to Josef?",
    "Oh no! I knew Denath was a dark wizard but I didn't think he'd kill one of his disciples. Let me look at the book then.",
    "I don't understand. What's in here that Denath thought was worth killing over? Josef must have worked something out - but what? But look at the incantation in the book. The words are in the reverse order to the order that Denath taught us.",
    "More likely the book has the correct incantation and the one Denath taught us was backwards. But what does that mean? Player, I'm not happy about this ritual. I don't think Agrith Naar is going to grant all our wishes, I think he's going to kill us all. But if I try to stop it, Denath will kill me like he did Josef!",
    "Thank goodness! I think Denath is nearly ready for the ritual. We must prepare!",
    "This is it! Get to your place in the circle and say the words!",
    "Of course! How could we be so stupid?",
    "What do you get when you perform a summoning ritual backwards? Denath was Agrith Naar all along! We've just helped him return to his own dimension!",
    "No, don't leave! Who knows what Denath could do now? We've got to perform the ritual again so you can kill Agrith Naar. But we need eight people! Quick, [Player], you've got to get those three to come back! And you'd better take Denath's sigil and find one more person to help.",
    "We've got to perform the ritual again, forwards this time, so you can kill Agrith Naar. I'll prepare for it here while you find four more people.",
    "Hurry!",
    "Denath must have been Agrith Naar all along! Ellemar's book said that Agrith Naar can only use his powerful magics from the demon plane. Ellemar must have trapped him in human form to stop him using his magics. That must be what the last pages of the book said. So the reason he assembled us was to send him back to his own plane, where he would be much more powerful! That's why the ritual was backwards! He's already started to close the portal to trap us. Who knows what else he could do? But if we can perform the ritual forwards then you can kill him using Silverlight and end his evil magics once and for all!",
    "We've got eight people now. Are you ready to summon Agrith Naar and slay him?",
    "*gulp* Okay, here we go...",
