The heaviest weight will always be random.`
Drag two sets of three weights onto both sides of the scale and click the central green gem to weigh.`
If one of the sides is heavier, you know the heaviest weight is part of the 3 weights that went down. Put one of those weights on the left side and one weight on the right side of the scale, the last one in the bottom row and click the green gem again. If either side went down you know the heaviest weight. If they are equal you know it's the one you put back in the bottom row.`
If both sides were of equal weight, you know the remaining 3 weights in the bottom row are the heaviest. Put one of those weights on the left side and one weight on the right side of the scale, the last one in the bottom row and click the green gem again. If either side went down you know the heaviest weight. If they are equal you know it's the one you put back in the bottom row.`
