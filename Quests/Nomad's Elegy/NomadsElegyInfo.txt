Return to the war table.`
Slowly walk the battering ram across the bridge and through the doors.`
It is recommended to use an Aggression potion for this next part, to keep the focus of the enemies on you rather than the battering ram.`
Suggestion 1: Put Zanik north-west by battering ram, Death north-east and the remaining four block off the start of the bridge while fighting.`
Suggestion 2: Place your companions three on each side of the ram, and stand on the bridge's edge blocking off all the monsters while using an aggression potion which requires level 82 Herblore. Fight or withstand the attacks until the ram is done.`
Choose to either assault the fortress head-on, or detour to the side.`

Items needed: Combat equipment and high-healing food`
Items recommended: High-tier shield for the use of resonance, stat-boosting potions, Guthix Staff, debuff spells, beast of burden, power armour (armour value doesn't matter)`
If at any point you wish to leave, go back to the entrance and select "quick leave". When you return, you will resume the fight at the beginning of that phase. If you die, your gravestone spawns outside Death's Hourglass.`
First combat phase`
Dwindle away Nomad's health, and move away from the centre of the bridge to avoid Gielinor's hand. Also move away from shadows that appear on the ground to avoid rapid powerful magic attacks. Use Surge if you can.`
Stand in the middle of each of the three sections in the area and constantly use the 3 abilities made available. Move to the next one when one side is finished.`
Use Fire Blast when Rorarii are present.`
Use Shield Dome when Gladii are present.`
Use Shadow Stalk when Scutarii are present.`
Every time you attack a Capsarii, it will heal Xenia for a small amount.`
In addition to the previous phase's attacks, when Nomad teleports you near him and orders you to 'face his wrath', switch to your shield to use Resonance to negate any and all damage from the attack.`
Go directly north, south, east and west of Gielinor. Each time provoking him and quickly getting out of the way, to then use Scythe on the hand, and finally claim the released spirit.`
In addition to the previous phases' attacks, Nomad will create a clone of himself when he reaches half health. Kill them both (you might kill Nomad first, in which case you will move on).
Quickly and without stopping, run around the area anti-clockwise, releasing the souls as you get in the middle of a group of them. Make sure to get over half of the initial total number of spirits.`
The more souls you release, the more powerful the attack reflected onto Gielinor will be.`
Once all souls have been released, continue circling until Gielinor stops firing the beam, then shield yourself from Gielinor's attack with the ability, in order to reflect the damage onto Gielinor.`
You will have to repeat this process a few times.`
In this phase, Nomad will only be using rapid melee attacks. Kill him by any means, if using Ranged or Magic, then you can run around the room to avoid damage from Nomad, using Surge to gain distance. Watch out for Gielinor's attacks.` 
Protect from Melee or Deflect Melee, especially combined with Devotion, can reduce or negate much of Nomad's damage in this phase, though the speed of his attacks can still be problematic.`
Choose who ends Gielinor.`
Decide Nomad's fate.`
After the cutscene, speak with Death.`
Choose Zanik's fate.`
Quest complete!
