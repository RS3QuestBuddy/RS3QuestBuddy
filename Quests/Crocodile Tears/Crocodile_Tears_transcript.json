    "Greetings, Player.",
    "Not at this moment: you need to learn more of the desert, first.",
    "Greetings, Player.",
    "Perhaps, but first let me tell you a story. My memories have only recently returned to me, and it is an indulgence to share them with someone. Early in my time as Pharaoh, I toured across my kingdom to learn more of the places and people within it. I travelled with a large retinue on a boat up and down the River Elid. Throughout our journey, we were followed by a large crocodile. A few times, we'd lose sight of it for days on end, only for it to make its presence known on the next morning. We did not know if it was stalking us or acting as an escort. Crocodiles were known to sometimes attack and eat humans, but they are also revered by us for their tenacity and modesty. All thought of it was forgotten, however, when we were set upon by a small scouting force of the ancient one. This was before open war had broken out with him. We managed to fend them off, but during the skirmish our boat was damaged and began taking on water. It was at this moment that the crocodile made its final appearance. The boat sank and we all found ourselves in the water with the crocodile, it's[sic] hunger ignited by the smell of blood in the air.",
    "Perhaps, but while she was being dragged away, it allowed the rest of us time to swim to the relative safety of the riverbank.",
    "I made it safely out of the water, my retinue putting themselves between me and the crocodile as we swam.",
    "In those times, life in this region was nowhere near as harsh as it can be now. It was not uncommon to see those who had difficulty dealing with abundance. One member of my retinue, whose particular vice was food, had grown quite large in her years. She swam slowly, but the crocodile did not... Within seconds it was on her, and dragged her beneath the surface, neither of them to be seen again.",
    "Within this event, I learned a truth. The crocodile, hungry as it was, could have easily attacked all of us, yet it chose to expend its efforts on only one. With the least amount of effort, it received the largest possible meal. While they may be dangerous animals, if you understand them you can safely navigate their waters. It also taught me a lesson in moderation, to only take what was needed - a lesson that has served my people well once this land became a desert.",
    "It appears that, in recent years, the crocodiles along the River Elid are no longer sated so easily. Leela?",
    "I need your help, Player. You must investigate why crocodiles have become so gluttonous of late. Something is not right.",
    "It has everything to do with Crondis.",
    "I see you do not connect this with the goddess Crondis? Go to the city of Sophanem: Leela tells me that the Sphinx still abides there. She and a local priest called Jex know much about minor deities. Discover all there is to know about a goddess called Crondis. Doing so will illuminate the importance of the desert crocodiles.",
    "Greetings, Player.",
    "Of course.",
    "Perhaps, but while she was being dragged away, it allowed the rest of us time to swim to the relative safety of the riverbank.",

    "I need your help, Player. You must investigate why crocodiles have become so gluttonous of late. Something is not right.",
    "I see you do not connect this with the goddess Crondis? Go to the city of Sophanem: Leela tells me that the Sphinx still abides there.

She and a local priest called Jex know much about minor deities. Discover all there is to know about a goddess called Crondis. Doing so will illuminate the importance of the desert crocodiles.",
    "Greetings, Player.",
    "Crondis was once a crocodile, turned into a deity by Tumeken, father of the Kharidian lands. Crocodiles are her symbol, her greatest supporters and her mortal embodiment. Of all the gods, Crondis is the most moderate. For the crocodiles of the Elid to so brazenly attack people suggests all is not well with her. It will not be long before this sign of such rapaciousness spreads to the people of the desert, if it has not done so already. The crocodiles must be restored their modesty. They must return to being measured, determined and restrained. I must ask that you do this for me. I cannot leave this tomb yet, and I need Leela to act as my temperance.",
    "There is a relic, housed within this mastaba, that should help you to locate Crondis. After the crocodile attack, my group was stranded in the desert. It was only through the learning of the crocodile's modesty that we were able to survive. As we set out on our long journey back home, we took what food and water we needed from the Elid and it sustained us. After these lands became a desert, however, finding food and water became much harder, and so I sought out a genie to create a relic for me with which to locate these things should I ever have need.",
    "Indeed, they are tricky and fickle beings, but not without their uses. This one created for me a dowsing rod, which can find an oasis in any desert. It is housed in the model barque - a replica of the boat that sank that day - on display in the entrance to this mastaba. You have my permission to remove this dowsing rod relic from my tomb without becoming cursed. Use it to locate Crondis and set things right.",
    "Greetings, Player.",
    "You are to recover the dowsing rod relic from the model boat within the entrance to this mastaba, and use it to located[sic] Crondis such that you may set things right with her.",
    "Greetings, Player.",
    "Being so far underground must be sending it haywire. Go up to the surface and try activating it.hings right with her.",
    "Greetings, Player.",
    "Of course! The rod hasn't been tuned to look for Crondis so it just searches for what it knows.",
    "I cannot, but I know the ones who can. You should seek out the Elid elementals. They can be found in a cavern at the source of the River Elid. Be careful, though. I have heard of adventurers perishing at the hands of the Saradominist golems that dwell there.",
    "Also, the dowsing rod relic can be used as a key to enter their dwelling.",
    "Greetings, Player.",
    "Well? Did the Elid elementals tune the dowsing rod to find Crondis?",
    "Please hurry. Travel to the source of the River Elid and find them. You can use the dowsing rod relic as a key to enter their dwelling.",
    "Greetings, Player.",
    "Ensure you show Crondis the proper respect - she is a goddess, after all.",
    "Greetings, Player.",
    "What did she say?",
    "What was it?",
    "A demon? This sounds like the work of Amascut. Whatever happens, you must rid Crondis of this entity. No doubt it was what was causing her greed.",
    "Greetings, Player.",
    "That is good news, but what of Crondis?",
    "I warned you both before - this is not a place for your squabbles.",
    "Do you not see the folly in that, Osman? People are ruled, not places.",
    "I'm sorry, Leela, but your father just isn't ready to listen.",
    "Greetings, Player.",
    "Let us not dwell on Osman's visit. How fare things with Crondis? I can feel her restraint returning to the desert. What caused it?",
    "Yet another scheme of the Devourer's. It concerns me greatly that there may be reason behind her acts of corruption we are yet to understand.",
    "That seems as good a plan as any, Player. Please continue to assist this Ozan character. For now, however...",
    "Greetings, Player.",
    "Thank you for setting things right with Crondis. I can already feel her modesty returning to the hearts of the Kharidian people."

  "Player": [
    "Can I be of service?",
    "Can I be of service?",
    "That's awful.",
    "What happened to you?",
    "What happened to your retinue?",
    "Where are you going with this?",
    "This is a nice story and all, but why mention it now?",
    "Sorry, I can't help right now.",
    "Is this something to do with Crondis?",
    "Why is this important? Can the locals not just fend off the crocodiles?",
    "Last time we spoke, you told me a story. Can we talk of it?",
    "That's awful.",
    "What happened to you?",
    "What happened to your retinue?",
    "Where are you going with this?",
    "This is a nice story and all, but why mention it now?",

    "Why is this important? Can the locals not just fend off the crocodiles?",
    "Hello, Jex.",
    "Could you tell me more about the minor gods?",
    "Could you tell me more about Crondis?",
    "That must be awkward when buying helmets.",
    "What kind of people follow her?",
    "How so?",
    "Why?",
    "Could you tell me more about Crondis's connection with crocodiles?",
    "I think I've learnt abough about Crondis... I think I understand why she is so important.",
    "Could you tell me more about Crondis's followers?",
    "I think I've learnt abough about Crondis... I think I understand why she is so important.",
    "Good day.",
    "Ummm, yes.",
    "I need help.",
    "Can you tell me about the gods of the Menaphites?",
    "Tell me about Crondis.",
    "Coming from a mixed up creature like yourself, that's an interesting criticism. Any other information you can impart?",
    "I think I've learnt abough about Crondis... I think I understand why she is so important.",
    "Okay, so you need me to discover where Crondis is and find out what might be wrong with her? How do I do that?",
    "That can't have been easy - I've had to deal with a genie myself, not long ago.",
    "What was I doing again?",
    "I've got the dowsing rod. Now what?",
    "This doesn't look like a place you'd find Crondis, I'll give this another try.",
    "I think I see a pattern here... One last try!",
    "Another Oasis!? [sic] This isn't working out, I'm heading back to Senliten.",
    "Senliten, the dowsing rod keeps taking me to oases in the desert. How can I make it lead me to Crondis?",
    "Could you charge it for me?",
    "Somehow I don't think that's going to be a problem.",
    "Oh, and I seem to remember I'll need a rope to get in...",
    "Oh, I haven't visited them yet.",
    "Hello? You know I'm here, right?",
    "I need your help to charge this dowsing rod - I'd like to find Crondis to discover why she's been so silent recently.",
    "So an intervention is in all four of our interests?",
    "I've found Crondis! The dowsing rod led me to a sunken pyramid in the mouth of the River Elid. There's a ferryman in Menaphos named Kags who's happy to take me there.",
    "I'll return and see if there is anything she can do to stop the crocodile attacks.",
    "Really, you don't charge?",
    "Are you okay? You seem like you don't want to be here.",
    "My name is Player. I came here to visit the, er, you...and to make sure everything was alright with you. Is it?",
    "There have been reports recently of crocodiles attacking people living on the river's edge.",
    "You might know how to put a stop to it?",
    "*whispers* Um, what should I do? Should we stand still so she can't see us?",
    "*whispers* Well, what then?",
    "*whispers* Where can I get a beltfish?",
    "Here, I have what you asked for!",
    "*whispers* Toothpicks? Where can I get toothpicks? Hey, also, what's a toothpick?",
    "Here, I have what you asked for!",
    "Here, I have what you asked for! Please let that be enough.",
    "Oh, thank goodne-",
    "*whispers* Sorry... What do you need?",
    "*whispers* That's the Agility Pyramid, right? Will do.",
    "Here, I have what you asked for!",
    "Here, I have what you asked for! Surely, you've had enough by now...oh, great Crondis?",
    "*whispers* Plovers?",
    "Here, I have what you asked for!",
    "Here, I have what you asked for!",
    "*whispers* Did she just eat all of those plovers? Excuse me, but did you just eat all of those plovers? It took me ages to catch those!",
    "*whispers* Thanks a lot, Tamsah; you're such a croccy's boy. Fine, where do I get these croc ices?",
    "Here, I have what you asked for!",
    "Here, I have what you asked for!",
    "THAT'S ENOUGH!",
    "Yes, I dare! Get a hold of yourself! You're nothing but a greedy bully! You're no goddess.",
    "You'll what?",
    "Go on, then, what are you going to do?",
    "Spit it out, already!",
    "I didn't mean literally!",
    "I put my foot down with Crondis - I told her outright there would be no more food deliveries from me.",
    "It's more what she did than what she said. She got so angry with me, I didn't know what she was going to do, but all of a sudden she stopped and something flew out of her mouth.",
    "I think it's some sort of crocodile demon, a manifestation of whatever was corrupting Crondis.",
    "I managed to defeat the crocodile demon!",
    "Oh, right, yes. I should probably go and check on her, see if she is alright.",
    "Is there anything you can do about the crocodiles attacking people?",
    "Be seeing you two!",
    "What would you have done if I wasn't around?",
    "Crondis is all better now, I think. After I destroyed her manifest corruption, she became a lot more reasonable. She agreed to put an end to the crocodile attacks immediately. The Devourer tricked her into ingesting some sort of corruption, which affected the crocodiles of the River Elid.",
    "What can we do but react as we discover each of her plots? It's not like we can just ask her.",
    "Ozan believes she's working below Menaphos.",
    "He's trying to track down what happened to the Kharid-ib. I'm helping him search the tombs beneath the city.",
    "Ah, so-so. How are things with you and Crondis?",
    "My travels are going so-so, but thank you, Crondis[sic]",
    "I should definitely get out of here."

  "Jex": [
    "Hello, Player.",
    "Jex rubs his head tenderly.",
    "Crondis is a ferocious lady with the head of a mighty crocodile.",
    "Enough flippancy: remember she is a deity, and this is her place of power.",
    "She embodies modesty, diligence and resourcefulness, so Crondis is worshipped by the desert's subsistence farmers and hunters. Conversely, she proves unpopular amongst society's elite.",
    "Crondis teaches that people should take no more than they need and make do with little, which, as you can imagine, conflicts with the values of many in the richer echelons of society. In Menaphos, she is particularly frowned upon, although that is hardly surprising.",
    "The Pharaoh of Menaphos is a greedy, cruel man whose lack of restraint is beyond even Crondis's help. Excuse me, I should not have spoken that way. It is unwise to speak ill of one's betters.",
    "Crondis was once a crocodile. Many people believe that those that hunt in the waters of the River Elid embody her very spirit. They were her most beloved supporters. When I was young, people were wary of them, revered them even, but were not afraid of them. With all the recent crocodile attacks, that has changed. I'm afraid that the growing lack of restraint of the crocodiles along the River Elid is only further proof that not all is well with Crondis.",
    "Crondis is worshipped by those who rely upon their own ingenuity to survive: sailors, engineers and rouges hold her in high regard. Due to her popularity amongst seafarers, word of Crondis has spread far and wide and her followers can be found in a great number of exotic places."

    "What with? Your cat tells me that you have held The Devourer at bay.",
    "I suppose I could spare a moment or two. Who do you want to know about?",
    "Crondis is the lesser deity of resourcefulness and unassuming cunning. She has the head of a crocodile, which I don't see as being physically pleasant.",

    "*snaps fingers*",
    "A croc ice! Just one, though; can't be greedy.",
    "Is there a frog in your throat, Tamsah? No? Want a crocodile in there?",
    "What was that? Speak up, high priest!",
    "That's so sweet. You may leave with my blessing, Player.",
    "Tamsah, can you come over here? My back needs doing and my arms are too small to reach.",
    "You should probably be on your way, Player. I think my high priest has forgotten I'm an all-powerful deity.",
    "I do, but remember your place.",
    "Ooh, is that Player? Ask them how their travels are going!",
    "I asked them, Tamsah...",
    "Stop being ridiculous, Tamsah.",
    "Cease your impudence! And come wash my back."

They are so delicious, it's hard to stop at just eating one. Though, you should be aware you'll have to deliver them by foot. Any sort of magical interference and they'll melt."
