Items needed: Crystal trinket, Death talisman`
Proceed to Thorgel in the temple. Do not teleport out of the room to the death altar as the light door will be locked on return.`
Do not use death altar teleport with wicked hood at this point unless you are absolutely certain the light beam is situated to let you out of the altar room.`
Or go up the centre stairs, south and up the ladder; down the central stairs, down again, walk through the light door, rotate mirror and enter the west room with the death altar and Thorgel.`

One example of a solution to directing a white light into the black receiver`
For this puzzle the position of the receivers differ from player to player. Make sure you have time available to complete the following portion of the quest, as it is instanced; i.e. if you log out, return to lobby, or die, you'll appear back at the death altar room.`
Another example of a solution where the white light needs to go into the fourth one, instead of the third`
Once inside, search the dead slave on the ground.`
Chop, then fix the eastern tree with the blue beam.
Solve the puzzles by reflecting the beams to the opposite coloured receivers. You only have one receiver available at a time. For example: if the receiver in the end is yellow and since the opposite of yellow is blue (refer to the colour wheel), you need to direct the blue light beam to the yellow receiver.`
Due to how mirrors reflect, you often have to reroute, just keep trying different paths for the quickest solution.`
Redirect the blue light to the yellow receiver. (This enables the red light.)`
Redirect a combination of red and blue light to the green receiver. (This enables the green light.)`
Redirect a combination of blue and green light to the red receiver.`
Redirect all three colours to the black receiver. (When done all receivers on the western wall will be white.)`
Refer to the in-depth guide if you can't figure it out.`
Exit using the ladder in the south-east (not the portal).`
If you die, your grave will appear behind the energised pillar. To get there, teleport to the Death Altar through the Abyss or the wicked hood if the door to the altar is unlocked. You will have to repeat the energisation process again to re-enter the platform puzzle area. Progress of the light puzzle will also be saved.`
