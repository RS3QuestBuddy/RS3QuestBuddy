For each of the below battles, I'd highly recommend that after you have positioned your allies that you stand around the area that you've placed Helwyr, as other than an impressive AoE ability, they're fairly weak and are likely going to be the reason that you fail if you try to AFK beyond the first battle.`
Stand just infront of Helwyr for each of the battles so you get to the enemies first, and try and attack each of them for a couple of hits each. You don't have to do a lot of damage. Be careful as the enemies will attack you back, but this will allow Helwyr and whoever you've put with them to easily finish them off for you. Plus, you'll get combat exp for each of the enemies that get finished off for you! Restock on food between the battles if need be.`
