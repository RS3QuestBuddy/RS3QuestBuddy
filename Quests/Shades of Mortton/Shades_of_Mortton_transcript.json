  "Ulsquire Shauncy": [
    "Ah, excellent, you've made your own serum and it seems to work well! Many thanks for using the Serum on me! But beware, I may start to change back soon!",
    "My name is Ulsquire Shauncy. I'm the local teacher and priest around here. You've really come at a time when Mort'ton is in a terrible state. The emanations from the rest of Morytania affect the people here terribly turning them into mindless creatures. And, as if that wasn't enough, we get picked off by the evil Shades that exist in this area.",
    "This sad and afflicted little town is called 'Mort'ton'. In it's heyday it was a busy and bustling market town with a specialty for interring the dead. The vile emanations from the Sanguinesti area started to spread and the town hasn't been the same since. The serum you made was the one that Herbi Flax was working on. Unfortunately the serum isn't permanent.",
    "I remember Herbi Flax talking about the serum. He said it worked on what he called the 'biological' effects of the affliction but that some other secondary effect was at work which he didn't quite understand. He was interested in 'Flaemtaer', the ruined temple to the North. I found this odd. A man of science studying a structure dedicated to faith and the struggle of good verus evil, another concept he didn't understand.",
    "The people are affected by the emanations from the rest of Morytania and the dead from the tombs have manifested into shadow creatures.",
    "They are the disturbed spirits of those interred in the earth beneath Mort'ton. Their eternal spirits have been poisoned by the close vicinity to the evil nature of the inhabitants of the Sanguinesti area.",
    "Well, there's my good friend Razmire Keelgan. He's a prominent shop owner in Mort'ton, at least he was before he was affected by the area. I know he tried to gather the militia together to fight the shades. He might know something about the temple. Razmire lives in the building to the west just over there, go and talk to him.",
    "Ah, excellent, you've made your own serum and it seems to work well! Many thanks for using the Serum on me! But beware, I may start to change back soon!",
    "Ah, hello again, what can I do for you now?",
    "Oh yes, well, that's very nice.",
    "That is a shame, I would have liked to have seen the remains. Razmire was right. I'm keen to study them and perhaps see if I can work out a way to put their spirits to rest.",
    "Oh yes, that would be interesting!",
    "Ah, hello again, what can I do for you now?",
    "The shade remains are made of a strange substance which I've not come across before. I believe we should put these tormented spirits to rest.",
    "Quite right... I was thinking that a holy cremation would do the trick, but the funeral pyres need specially prepared 'pyre logs' - normal logs that have been treated with 'sacred oil' to give it a nice holy touch.",
    "You won't! It's a pagan secret lost a long time ago. Normally I would try to bless some commonly found vegetable oil, but I'm so weak from this illness that I know I just won't be able to do it. Huh! I used to joke with Herbi Flax that if 'Flaemtaer temple' was still standing, we could practice some ancient pagan rituals and incite the sacred flame! Huh, I'm not surprised that he never took me seriously!",
    "Hmm, interesting question. It is an ancient pagan temple referred to as Flaemtaer. I've studied it quite a lot, one day I hope to be able to rebuild it, who knows what ancient power it could unleash?",
    "I couldn't do it alone, I'd need a few expert artisans to help with the construction. I'd also need a good supply of limestone bricks, swamp paste and timber beams. Thankfully Razmire stocks all these items. (Sigh)",
    "The serum is a product of science. Herbi was a clever man to have made it, but he didn't integrate anything from the spiritual world into his work - and for all of his hard science there is still something missing.",
    "I'm a man of faith...that's all I know. Sometimes I feel that we should experiment with the sacred and the holy, not just the crude matter we find around us everyday.",
    "That's up to you my friend! I once heard someone say that making your own decisions is the only real freedom you have. Exercise your freedom my friend, while you still can.",
    "That's great, carry on the good work. I'm sure that the temple is the key to unlocking a better life for all of us in Mort'ton.",
    "I've researched this much, it seems that the temple was dedicated to the worship of elemental flame or fire. The sacred flame was said to be very holy and was used somehow to sanctify oil for use in cremations. The pagans believed that sacred oil sanctified the cremation ceremony and thus helped the deceased pass onto the next life, and it helped the logs to burn! In case there's any truth in the story, have this!",
    "I'm not surprised. The temple represents holiness. They may feel that it has power over them in some way. My advice is to carry on and finish the temple if you can and see what happens. You many need help though!",
    "You may need help building the temple or defending yourself against the Shades. I'm sure if you ask around nicely you would be able to get some help.",
    "I'd go and see Razmire, perhaps he has some items in stock?",
    "From what I've learned, the ancients used to use the sacred oil on logs in order to make pyre logs for cremation. You could try that!",
    "Great! Well done my friend!",
    "Ah, hello again, what can I do for you now?",
    "Hello again! Many thanks for helping us to solve the riddle with the Shades, we can start to work now putting all those Shade spirits to rest and get a little bit of a reward to go along with it!",
    "Well done... I feel this serum is really working on me. I think you've cracked it my friend! I'd like to give you something for your trouble!"

    "Who are you?",
    "Wow, you guys seem to be really at the bottom of the food chain around here.",
    "What is this place?",
    "Do you know how I could make the serum permanent?",

    "What's going on around here?",
    "What are all these shadowy creatures?",
    "Yes, I'll dispatch those dark and evil creatures.",
    "Sorry, not right now, I need to do something else first.",
    "Is there anything worth doing around here?",
    "No not yet!",
    "Yes I have actually!",
    "Yes I have actually!",
    "Ok, thanks",

    "Ok, thanks",
    "Ok, thanks",
    "Razmire said to come and talk to you.",
    "I just slayed five shades for Razmire...he said that you might be interested in seeing the shade remains. Unfortunately I don't have any with me at the moment...",
    "I just slayed 5 shades for Razmire, he said you might be interested in seeing some shade remains?",
    "What did you find out about the remains.",
    "How can we do that? You can't even bury the remains!",
    "How would I make some sacred oil?",
    "What can you tell me about that temple?",
    "How can you rebuild a totally destroyed temple?",
    "Do you know how I could make this serum permanent?",
    "So, you don't know then!",
    "What should I do now?",
    "Ok, thanks",
    "Hello there, I've started repairing the temple.",
    "What should I do when the temple is built?",
    "The Shades keep knocking the temple down!",
    "I keep running out of building materials!",
    "Can you open a store for me?",
    "Ok, thanks.",

    "Tell me more about the Shades. [Appears if you've talked about the shades knocking the temple down]",
    "I keep running out of building materials!",
    "Ok, thanks.",
    "Hello there, I used the olive oil on the flame and it gave me sacred oil! What should I do now?",
    "Hey, I've laid a Shade to rest, can you tell me where the Shade lair is now?",
    "Can you open a store for me?",

    "Ah, excellent, you've made your own serum and it seems to work well! Many thanks for using the Serum on me! But beware, I may start to change back soon!",
    "Ah, it's you, how's it going?",
    "My name is Razmire Keelgan, I run a couple of shops in Mort'ton but don't get much custom these days.",
    "I run a general store with a few useful items, and I have a building supplies store, I'm hoping that when things get better down here, people will want to buy items to repair their buildings.",
    "Well to be honest, all of my stock is packed away right now seeing as the town is all overrun with these Shades. I tell you what. You put an end to five Shades for me and I'll open the store for you! I have details on that dilapidated temple to the North. These shades have a purpose - they jealously guard their burial treasure! If you can do me some favours, I could help you to locate it!",

If you can do me some favours, I could help you to locate it!",
    "This place is called Mort'ton, it used to be a quiet town with a specialism in death. That is to say that many burial tombs were created here in the naturally formed caves under this very village.",
    "Well, the people of the village, my usual customers... are all affected by the emanations from some place to the North East. Ulsquire can give you the name. Needless to say Herbi was working on a serum to help us and you stumbled across the recipe! I for one am grateful to you, but there's a lot left to do before Mort'ton is returned to its former glory.",
    "Those disgusting entities are the filth that have ruined my life. They're the restless spirits of the dead who jealously guard their burial treasure yet feed on the the living. I've heard that they jealously guard their tomb treasure and that it's worth plundering. I need you to kill five shades and bring me their remains so that I can conduct some experiments. Will you do it?",
    "Great, that's what I wanted to hear. When you've done it, bring back all the remains,  I want to inspect them.",
    "Ok, fair enough...",
    "Life is a daily struggle with those Shades around here. They attack when you least expect it...it's terrifying! I tell you what, if you kill five of those Shades I'll see if I can help you out! Is it a deal?",
    "Hey, have you killed the five shades yet?",
    "Come back then when you have. And remember to bring me the remains, Ulsquire seems to think we might be able to send these poor souls to a better place.",
    "Hmm, yes, but you don't have the asked of you! Come back when you have them.",
    "Great, I'll experiment on these! I think that Ulsquire might be keen to see some shade remains, if you take some over to him, he can possibly give you some extra information about them. Now that you've slayed some of those nasty shades, feel motivated to help you out, I can trade with you now if you like.",
    "Have you killed those Shades yet?",
    "Well, come back when you have.",
    "Hello again...what can I do for you now?",
    "Ulsqire[sic] says they're the incarnation of the dead who were interred in the tombs under Mort'ton. If you can find a way to put these spirits to rest, I'll show you a way into their lair! Mind you...there must be thousands of them buried under there! Just imagine all the treasure they buried under there!",
    "It's ancient and has been desecrated since before I was born. I've always felt that it was quite a nice place to sit and have a picnic, quite a nice view out of the swamps of Mort Myre. I told Ulsquire that if he can afford to go halves with me on the building materials, I'd help him to one day. I've always wondered pagan times.",
    "I'd say not my friend. That clever Flax chap was always experimentatin', I guess he was a scholarly type. He always dismissed Ulsquires learned speculations about the temple, I'd say that was a bit short sighted myself.",
    "Well, you made the serum yourself so I guess you'll experimentate with it. I'd say that the temple might be able to change the serum in some way. Well, yes, I guess it sounds superstitious, but what's to be lost?",
    "Sure, which store do you wanna see?",
    "That's great, carry on the good work.",
    "Well, you could always have a nice picnic... oh... but then there's the problem with the Shades... hmmm, not nice... not nice at all! Well, I'll be honest, I don't really know! But I bet Ulsquire will know.",
    "Interesting... perhaps they have something against the temple? Perhaps it represents something bad to them? Hmmm, interesting stuff, but you'd best speak to Ulsquire about that sort of thing... do you need any supplies?",
    "Oh really... that's interesting... I have just the thing for you!",
    "Ah, it's you, how's it going?",
    "Yeah, great job putting that Shade to rest. The entrance to the Shade Lair is due North of my shop. Good hunting in the lair my friend!",
