    "Take pity on me, please - eternity stretches out before me and I am helpless in its grasp.",
    "Oh, I'm sorry - I was just wailing out loud. I didn't mean to scare you.",
    "Do you know the history of our town?",
    "Would you help us obtain our release into the next world?",
    "Do you know why ghosts exist?",
    "Yes, that is normally the case. But here in Port Phasmatys, we of this town once chose freely to become ghosts!",
    "It is a long story. Many years ago, this was a thriving port, a trading centre to the eastern lands. We became rich on the profits made from the traders that came across the eastern seas. We were very happy... until Lord Drakan noticed us. He sent unholy creatures to demand that a blood-tithe be paid to the Lord Vampyre, as is required from all in the domain of Morytania. We had no choice but to agree to his demands. As the years went by, our numbers dwindled and many spoke of abandoning the town for safer lands. Then, Necrovarus came to us. He came from the eastern lands, but of more than that, little is known. Some say he was once a mage, some say a priest. Either way, he was in possession of knowledge totally unknown to even the most learned among us. Necrovarus told us that he had been brought by a vision he'd had of an underground source of power. He inspired us to delve beneath the town, promising us the power to repel the vampyres. Deep underneath Phasmatys, we found a pool of green slime that Necrovarus called ectoplasm. He showed us how to build the Ectofuntus, which would turn the ectoplasm into the power he had promised us. Indeed, this Ectopower did repel the vampyres; they would not enter Phasmatys once the Ectofuntus began working. But little did we know that we had exchanged one evil for yet another - Ectopower. Little by little, we began to lose any desire for food or water, and our desire for the Ectopower grew until it dominated our thoughts entirely. Our bodies shrivelled and, one by one, we died. The Ectofuntus and the power it emanates keeps us here as ghosts - some, like myself, content to remain in this world; some becoming tortured souls who we do not allow to pass our gates. We would be able to pass over into the next world but Necrovarus has used his power to create a psychic barrier, preventing us. We must remain here for all eternity, even unto the very end of the world.",
    "Would you help us obtain our release into the next world?",
    "No, you're right - it's our own fault. If you do change your mind though, please come back and help us. We will be here ... forever.",
    "Oh, thank you! Necrovarus will not listen to those of us who are already dead. He might rethink his position if someone with a mortal soul pleaded our cause. If he declines, there may yet be another way.",
    "I sense that you have not yet spoken to Necrovarus.",
    "Well, I suppose we do have all the time in the world...",
    "I feared as much. His spirit is a thing of fire and wrath.",
    "It is only a small chance. During the building of the Ectofuntus one of Necrovarus's disciples spoke out against him. It is such a long time ago I cannot remember her name, although I knew her as a friend. She fled before the Ectofuntus took control over us, but being a disciple of Necrovarus she would have been privy to many of his darkest secrets. She may know of a way to aid us without Necrovarus.",
    "I have a vision of a small wooden shack, the land it was built on the unholy soil of Morytania. I sense the sea is very close, and that there looms castles to the west and the east.",
    "She was a friend of mine. Had she died, I would have felt her spirit pass over to the next world, though I may not follow.",
    "Nobody knows what has happened to the Book. It was stolen when our port was raided by pirates many years ago, and never seen since.",
    "I imagine they are still worn by his mortal body, which now lies in a coffin inside the Temple.",
    "I don't really know. You could try asking some of the traders from the East - they might be able to help you.",
    "How is it going?",
    "Oh, kind [sir/lady] - you are the answer to all our prayers!",
    "You don't need to tell me Player- I sensed the removal of Necrovarus's psychic barrier!",
    "Here, take this as a thank you for the service that you have given us.",
    "This is an Ectophial. If you ever want to come back to Port Phasmatys, empty this on the floor beneath your feet, and you will be instantly teleported to the temple - the source of its power. Remember that once the Ectophial has been used you need to refill it from the Ectofuntus.",
    "All in good time, Player. We stand forever in your debt, and will certainly put in a good word for you when we pass over.",
    "Of course you can, you have helped us more than we could ever have hoped."
  ],
  "Player": [
    "Why, what is the matter?",
    "No, that's okay - it takes more than a ghost to scare me. What is wrong?",
    "Yes, I do. It is a very sad story.",
    "No - could you tell me?",
    "A ghost is a soul left in limbo, unable to pass over to the next world; they might have something left to do in this world that torments them, or they might just have died in a state of confusion.",
    "Why on earth would you do such a thing?",
    "That's a very sad story.",
    "I'm sorry, but it isn't really my problem.",
    "Yes, of course I will. Tell me what you want me to do.",
    "Leave me alone - I'm scared of ghosts!!!",
    "No, I was just getting to that.",
    "I must speak with you on behalf of Velorina.",
    "She wants to pass-",
    "But she-",
    "Please, listen to me-",
    "I'm sorry, but Necrovarus will not let you go.",
    "You spoke of another way.",
    "Do you know where this woman can be found?",
    "If it was such a long time ago, won't she be dead already?",
    "I'm here about Necrovarus. Were you once a disciple of Necrovarus in the Temple of Phasmatys, old woman?",
    "Is there anything that can help to refresh your memory?",
    "Do you know where I can find nettles around here?",
    "Here's some tea for you, like you asked.",
    "I see. Can I have this special cup, then?",
    "Here's a lovely cup of tea for you, in your own special cup.",
    "Here's a lovely cup of milky tea for you, in your own special cup.",
    "I have come from Velorina. She needs your help.",
    "She's a ghost, I'm afraid.",
    "She and many others want to pass on into the next world, but Necrovarus will not let them. Do you know of any way to help them?",
    "No I don't, I'm afraid.",
    "Yes, I'm carrying one in my bag.",
    "Yes, I'm wearing one right now.",
    "What do you need to perform the enchantment?",
    "You are doing so much for me - is there anything I can do for you?",
    "That's the second saddest story I have heard today.",
    "Was this his boat?",
    "If I find him, I will pass it on.",
    "Remind me - what can I do about Necrovarus?",
    "What did you want me to get for you?",
    "I'll go and search for those items you need.",
    "I am afraid I have not found your son yet.",
    "I am afraid I have lost the boat you gave to me.",
    "Wheels have been set in motion, Necrovarus; wheels that will set the citizens of Port Phasmatys free.",
    "Do you know where I can find the Book of Haricanto?",
    "Do you know where I can find the Robes of Necrovarus?",
    "I need something to translate the Book of Haricanto.",
    "How is it going?",
    "What is your name?",
    "You're the cabin boy?!?",
    "Can I have the key to the chest?",
    "Is this your toy boat?",
    "Your mother gave it to me to pass on to you.",
    "Yes, in a shack to the west of here.",
    "Can I have the key to the chest, then?",
    "I've lost my key to the chest - do you have another one?",
    "Sorry, I won't do it again...",
    "Good news! I have found your son!",
    "He lives on a shipwreck to the east of here. He remembers you and wishes you well.",
    "Err, I was just curious...",
    "Do you have any jobs I can do?",
    "Yes, I'd be delighted.",
    "No, I didn't mean a job like that.",
    "After hearing Velorina's story I will be happy to help out.",
    "I must let you know, Necrovarus, that I am collecting signatures from the citizens of Port Phasmatys.",
    "Would you sign this petition form, please?",
    "Would you sign this petition form, please?",
    "Would you sign this petition form, please?",
    "Would you sign this petition form, please?",
    "Would you sign this petition form, please?",
    "How much?",
    "Okay, if you insist.",
    "There's no way I'm giving in to corruption.",
    "I don't have that many on me.",
    "Would you sign this petition form, please?",
    "Necrovarus, I am presenting you with a petition form that has been signed by 10 citizens of Port Phasmatys.",
    "It says that the citizens of Port Phasmatys should have the right to choose whether they pass over into the next world or not, and not have this decided by the powers that be on their behalf.",
    "So you will let them pass over if they wish?",
    "Really?",
    "It matters not that you ignore your citizens' wishes, Necrovarus. Wheels have been set in motion, wheels that will set them free.",
    "So, have you changed your mind yet?",
    "Yes. He burned it.",
    "Well, if you knew that he would do that, why have I been wasting my time running around after ghosts for signatures?",
    "It's nice to see a human face around here.",
    "You come from the lands of the East? Do you have anything that can help me translate a book that is scribed in your language?",
    "How much do you want for it?",
    "What would you like me to do?",
    "Okay, wait here - I'll get you your bow.",
    "Sorry, I have too much to do at the moment.",
    "Have you got an oak shieldbow that I can get Robin to sign for you?",
    "Well done, you beat me.",
    "So are you going to pay up then? You owe me [25/50/75] gold coins!",
    "What if you lose again?",
    "I've had enough of you not paying up - you owe me 100 gold coins. I'm going to tell the ghosts what you're doing.",
    "How about you signing my shieldbow then?",
    "So, still here then.",
    "You have a serious gambling problem, you know.",
    "I need you to sign another shieldbow.",
    "Yes, I'll give you a game.",
    "How do you play Runedraw?",
    "No, I don't approve of gambling.",

    "Actually, I haven't tried it yet.",
    "I have had the Amulet of Ghostspeak enchanted, which I shall use to command Necrovarus to set you free.",

    "Only happy to help out.",

    "Well, that's a stroke of luck.",
    "There is an enchantment that I can perform on such an amulet that will give it the power of command over ghosts. It will work only once, but it will enable you to command Necrovarus to let the ghosts pass on.",
    "Necrovarus had a magical robe for which he must have no more use. Only these robes hold the power needed to perform the enchantment. All his rituals came from a book written by an ancient sorcerer from the East called Haricanto. Bring me this strange book. I cannot read the strange letters of the eastern lands. I will need something to help me translate the book.",
    "I have lived here on my own for many years, but not always. When I left Port Phasmatys, I took my son with me. He grew up to be a fine boy, always in love with the sea. He was about twelve years old when he ran away with some pirates to be a cabin boy. I never saw him again.",
    "If you ever see him, please give him this...and tell him that his mother still loves him.",

Each rune has a different value: an air rune is worth one point, up to a Nature rune which is worth nine points. If a player draws the Death rune then the game is over, and they have lost. A player can choose to hold if they wish and not draw any more runes, but this runs the risk of the other player drawing more runes until they have a greater points total and win."
