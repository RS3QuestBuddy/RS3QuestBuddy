    "Of course! That's how everyone does it, right?",
    "Not so great. Bailry and I were at the Fishing Platform when... well, that's why I'm here. We need your help.",
    "Well, this old guy approached me...",
    "An old guy in white armour told me I could find you here. I think his name was Tefal, or maybe Tiffin.",
    "That's it: Sir Tipsy! He said we were needed for an important mission, killing the Slug queen or somesuch. What do you say?",
    "Great stuff! I'll meet you and the others somewhere a little more private.",
    "Okay, never mind. Come back when you're free.",
    "Let's get the others involved!",
    "Well, I don't know much, but some woman named Savloy found a way to beat the slugs once and for all.",
    "I think it was a way to combat the Slug Queen's mind controlling abilities.",
    "I'm not too sure of the details. Perhaps the girl can tell you more. If she's not busy playing with her hair, or something.",
    "Haha! To stop you all from dying, of course! That old Sir Tipple guy said my abilities would be necessary.",
    "I'm not too sure of the details. Perhaps the girl can tell you more. If she's not busy playing with her hair, or something.",
    "I can't get over how old you are.",
    "Haha! You should see the look on your face!",
    "Just get on with it.",
    "Hi! How can I help?",
    "We need to get our hands on a 'seeker gland'. And not just any seeker gland. A powerful creature once lived here. We should seek it out.",
    "Good, I reckon I'm certainly feeling okay.",
    "Fine, I guess. The slugs won't come into our house, so they're safe.",
    "I uh..she's okay, I guess.",
    "What? I didn't say..uh...",
    "Oh, right, sure.",
    "Well, to me it's not really magic.",
    "Yeah, but to me it's as easy as breathing. You just call it 'magic' because you don't understand why it works.",
    "I could try. Ask me again later. We've got a job to do.",
    "What about that thing?",
    "Don't listen to those chumps. Pick me! You know I'll get the job done.",
    "Good choice, Player. I'll have this done in no time.",
    "Nothing to it.",
    "You picked him? Why the...!",
    "You picked her? Why the...!",
    "Picking the girl *grumble* Silly... long hair...",
    "There's still a few more things we need for the anti-mind control serum. A live specimen.",
    "And the blood of a thrall, freely given. Giving the blood freely has an effect on the composition of the serum.",
    "Are you ready to head to the Fishing Platform?",
    "Settle down. Would you rather walk? Ah, Player. Good to see you made it in one piece. Let's get straight down to business. We need a couple more ingredients for an effective defence against the queen's mind control. Firstly, we've got to catch a live specimen.",
    "Secondly, we'll need the blood of a thrall, freely given.",
    "Unfortunately not. Giving the blood freely has an effect on the composition of the serum.",
    "No problem. Just come speak to me when you're ready.",
    "If you insist. See you later.",
    "Brilliant. Here's the seeker gland.",
    "Now, you just need to mix them using a pestle and mortar. I think I saw one on the table in here.",
    "Excellent, the serum seems complete. Good work! Now, let's get to the citadel.",
    "You lost the seeker gland, didn't you?",
    "Never mind, here it is.",

    "Yeah yeah, we get the picture.",
    "Me? Oh, I'm not here. You have no problem with me.",
    "Hi! How can I help?",
    "Put an end to the Slug Queen, I guess.",
    "It always is!",
    "I might, but they'd need to see it as I do. Imagine a box.",
    "This box contains everything you can perceive with your physical senses. Sight, touch, smell. You need to think outside of that box.",
    "Not very big, but that's unimportant. The box has four walls, and it's behind the fourth that your answers lie.",
    "Haha! Never mind.",
    "Some might call it coincidence. After the mess at the Fishing Platform, I came looking for you, but wasn't sure where to start. After a while, I ended up in a city with white walls and knights. I stopped for a break on a park bench. An old man there offered some tea and we got talking. It turns out he knew of you, and Ezekial, and the slug menace. He gave me a glass orb and told me I should wait at 'Daemonholmes' or something. That's about it.",
    "Luck, uh...yeah, sure.",
    "She started it! She's afraid of what I can do.",
    "Yeah, but she looks down on me...like I'm a kid. Silly long hair, hitting things with a large piece of metal. Neanderthal!",
    "There's nothing else in the room. Perhaps it controls the doors?",
    "Ezekial and I can take the serum. You two just, uh... distract her.",
    "We'll see about that.",
    "Why don't you be good and open this door for me?",
    "You ready, Ezekial?",
    "Yeah, I'm pretty sure she's not getting back up.",
    "She didn't need to hear the truth. You did a good thing.",
    "That was horrible...",
    "Hi! How can I help?",
    "Mission complete. Time to head home, I guess.",
    "Yeah, but...I was really starting to enjoy myself. The life of an adventurer. Your life... I need to think.",
    "Good, I reckon. I'm certainly feeling okay.",
    "Thanks, Eva. You did well too, I guess.",
    "I've been giving it some thought, and I don't think I'm ready to head home just yet. There's more adventure to be had. I may go see the Wizard's Tower. Who knows? Maybe Sir Taffy will have some more work for me."

    "I've been keeping busy: fishing, running the shop. Business has been good.",
    "Yeah, but they still need bait! Everyone needs bait!",
    "The key ingredient's that rubium ore we found. As you saw, it reacted with water, so, I thought, what else might it react with? Suffice to say, I found something more... uh.. Volatile.",
    "Nah, not really. He's spent most of his time at the Fishing Platform, helping to manage the slug problem. He's been growing up so fast.",
    "You know, he really looks up to you. I think that's a reason for his change in attitude. He wants to impress you.",
    "Yeah, but let's not chat now. We've got a mission to complete.",
    "What is that thing?",
    "I could do that if you like. The thing looks fishy, and I'm pretty hands-on where that's concerned!",
    "Wow, thanks, Player! I won't let you down.",
    "Cheers, Player, any time.",
    "You should speak to Bailey. He's a good chap and can probably help us out.",
    "Ahem! Greetings, my brethren. Pray, may we enter this glorious place such that...",

    "Uh...yeah. The pain of this existence is too much to bear.",
    "Hey Player!",
    "Haha, don't ask me! I'm just along for the ride.",
    "Yeah, he's been asking after you, especially since things got interesting at the Fishing Platform. Looks like he went halfway across the world to track you down. And now we are here. He's certainly persistent.",
    "She seems nice, very strong.",
    "She doesn't like Kennith, though. Don't think she trusts him. What do you think of her?",

    "Hey Player!",
    "Well, the queen is dead, the villagers have regained their senses, and I'm really hungry. I guess we head back to the surface.",
    "Did you not see the squishy mess Eva left behind? The Queen's dead, and, without her, the slugs are merely molluscs. Witchhaven and the Fishing Platform can finally return to normal.",

    "The Temple Knight seers have located a strange beast within the dungeons. They say it has its own live mind, which should counteract the Slug Queen's mind control. Since mind controlling her thralls is one of Mother Mallum's greatest weapons...",
    "Exactly!",
    "Not you as well. I may be a woman, but I can wield a sword just as well... No, better han any other Temple Knight! I've been following your progress through mission reports, so when the call came, I volunteered to fight by your side.",
    "That's enough chit-chat. Let's get ourselves into this dungeon!",
    "Ezekial, you're up!",
    "Player. What can I do for you?",
    "The seers spoke of a 'Seeker of Truth' within Daemonheim. Withing its body, we can find a gland that is critical to this mission.",
    "They've done their part. The rest is up to us.",
    "I...I'm fine, thank you.",
    "It was the seers. I'm not sure how they do what they do, nor do I care to find out. All I know is that my blade is needed here.",
    "His is not a happy tale. We managed to recover him, but not before he was taken as a slug host. The parasite's feelers went too deep and couldn't be removed safely. I know they interrogated him, but I don't think they revealed much.",
    "We're all soldiers and he knew the risks. But you're right, he didn't deserve this.",
    "I...well...yes. After my parents..He raised me as his own. When I was old enough, I enrolled with the Temple Knights. Uncle wasn't happy and wanted to protect me, but I know this is where I need to be. There's too much..bad in the world. Someone has to face it.",

    "There's only one thing to do. Put an end to the queen's vile existence.",
    "It's time to take the fight to the enemy. The vile parasites are using corpses to do their dirty work. We should avoid harming the villagers, but don't be afraid to put the risen knights to rest.",
