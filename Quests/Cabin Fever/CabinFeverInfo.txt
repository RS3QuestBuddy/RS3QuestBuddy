Search the gun locker and take at least 5 cannonballs and fuses.`
Fire the cannon with cannonballs until you put three holes in the enemy's ship. This is done with the same sequence above, except instead of a canister, a cannonball is used instead. You will likely have to fire it more than three times and possibly repair it multiple times using cannon barrels from the gun locker. If the cannon blows up while firing, take another cannon barrel from the gun locker and repair the cannon again.`
