    "I interviewed the sole surviving member before penning my report to Adrasteia.",
    "They gave me a very...graphic description of events.",
    "It certainly wasn't discreet. Moia was trying to make a statement and by all accounts, she succeeded.",
    "The survivor told me Moia and her forces approached from the north-east, in the direction of the volcano.",
    "Heading there is our best bet.",
    "Right, are you ready to get going?",
    "These banners... It's the star of chaos, the symbol of Bilrach's forces.",
    "Judging by the depth of these footprints, it can't have been abandoned more than a few days ago.",
    "Oh, that doesn't surprise me. Zemouregal was stationed here and he loves a bit of necromancy.",
    "He's certainly not the type to let deceased troops go to waste.",
    "Hmm... What do we have here?",
    "Interesting.",
    "It appears to be a memory fragment.",
    "I've heard Mahjarrat have a tendency to leak memories all over the place.",
    "Memory incontinence, if you will.",
    "Let's just say it's one of several subjects I am intimately familiar with.",
    "This memory, though...",
    "I'm sensing hate, bitterness and a whole load of daddy issues within it.",
    "Yes, this seepage has 'Moia' written all over it.",
    "Unfortunately, this fragment is too faint to be of use to us in its current state.",
    "But I know magic that should be able to strengthen the memory.",
    "First, we need to search the area for any locations that resonate with the memory.",
    "Search the area and see what you can find.",
    "Search the area for any locations that resonate with the memory.",
    "It's discomforting, seeing Forinthry crawling with Zamorakians.",
    "It's the ancient name of the Wilderness.",
    "I like to paint it occasionally. What it may once have looked like, I mean. As part of the Zarosian Empire.",
    "It seems that your investigation worked! The memory is stirring.",
    "I can channel a spell that will draw out other memories in the area, but I'll need you to gather them.",
    "My spell will draw out other memories in the area, but I need you to gather them.",
    "That seems to have done the trick. The memory is stable now.",
    "As stable as we're likely to get it, at least. On a scale of one to ten, I'd give it a solid three and a half.",
    "'We'? Oh no, no, no. This next bit is all on you, buddy.",
    "I'm not touching Moia's psyche with a ten-foot pole.",
    "You know a thing or two about divination, right? Just poke the memory or something, I'm sure you'll figure it out.",
    "But be careful! You know what they say about dying inside someone's memories.",
    "It's a minor inconvenience.",
    "Enter the memory when you're ready.",
    "Hey! You alright? You still with me?",
    "Good. How was seeing things from Moia's point of view?",
    "You scarred for life?",
    "Interesting... So what happened at the border was not a direct order from Bilrach.",
    "We shouldn't linger here. This area isn't safe.",
    "The fragments seem to be leading to the north. Let's continue our investigation there.",
    "A few months. I rose through the ranks quickly due to the high quality of my reports.",
    "With a ruler as inexperienced as her, I thought it best to keep things simple to understand.",
    "Besides, I do believe I did an immaculate job.",
    "I perfectly captured Moia's luscious hair, and her vacant expression.",
    "Adrasteia has a lot of potential, but she's out of her depth.",
    "It's sink or swim, and she's treading water.",
    "That was a lot of water-based metaphors. Now I'm thirsty.",
    "I've been in this line of work for a long, long time.",
    "I did go on a bit of an involuntary hiatus. When I came back, things were practically unrecognisable.",
    "Can't the world go five minutes without some outrageous drama?",
    "Doesn't she just? At least she has something going for her.",
    "Agreed. I think I see another memory fragment. Let's check it out.",
    "Hmmm...",
    "This one is more recent. But it's still too weak to be of use in its current state.",
    "As before, let's see if there are any locations nearby that resonate with the memory.",
    "Search the area for any locations that resonate with the memory.",
    "That seems to have done the trick.",
    "I'll use the same technique as last time. Get ready to gather the fragments.",
    "My spell will draw out other memories in the area, but I need you to gather them.",
    "Looks like this memory is good to go.",
    "You know the drill now, let's see what secrets Moia's hiding in this one.",
    "What did you see?",
    "I believe there is a portal to the source at the centre of the Wilderness crater.",
    "Did you see anything else?",
    "I see.",
    "You shouldn't, of course.",
    "Come, we need to hurry if we want to catch Moia.",
    "Here we are. The site where the gods were banished.",

    "Let's investigate.",
    "This portal...",
    "This portal must be where the Wilderness connects to the Infernal Source.",
    "But it's sealed.",
    "Take a look at it and see what you can uncover. I'll get this portal open.",
    "While you were watching the memory, I got the portal working.",
    "Be prepared. It seems we have company.",
