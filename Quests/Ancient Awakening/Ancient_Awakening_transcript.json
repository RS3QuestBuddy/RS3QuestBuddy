    "Perhaps, Your Grace. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to consider any potential security risk, and proceed with caution. Wouldn't you agree?",
    "Welcome to the command centre.",
    "Have you talked to Aster in the dragonkin tomb yet?",
    "I have commissioned a boat from the Fremennik people suitable for such an endeavor[sic]. It is docked within the grove.",
    "Given our supplies, I suggest a small, highly specialised team. Those who remain can defend the fort from any unwelcome guests.",
    "We will also need someone with combat experience.",
    "Sof\u00eda, perhaps?",
    "Additionally, I suggest you take Bill. His experience will be crucial in establishing a safe outpost.",

    "You're reading it backwards. The island is called 'Ungael'.",
    "'Ungael'...Siv confirmed that was the name of the mystery island on the map.",

    "I don't believe we've had the chance to speak face-to-face like this since the incident with the dragonkin device.",
    "Can you tell me more about how you met king[sic] Roald?",
    "You wanted to publicly humiliate the king?",
    "What happened?",
    "That must have meant a lot.",
    "How does he feel about you staying at the fort?",
    "Have you considered what we discussed about revealing your identity?",
    "The Raptor's voice is strikingly different to your own. How does that work?",
    "Really?",
    "Let's skip the small talk. What did you bring me here to discuss?",
    "That's enough questions. What did you bring me here to discuss?",
    "I agree. It's time we send an expedition to Ungael and put a stop to his plan. I'll gather the fort staff in the townhall at once.",
    "I'll find them. See you at the fort.",
    "Aster? What are you doing here?",
    "Is there really nothing else you want to discuss?",
    "That grave behind you...is that where-",
    "...",
    "I'm here for you if you ever want to talk, you know?",
    "We will be embarking on an expedition to Ungael. I need you back at the fort to discuss preparations.",
    "Zemouregal is likely heading towards Ungael as we speak. If he were to get his hands on this weapon...",
    "He could destroy everything we've worked to build here.",
    "We will send an expedition to Ungael to establish an outpost and secure this weapon before Zemouregal can.",
    "Besides, the Raptor will be there to protect you.",
    "No, Princess, you can't come, it's too dangerous.",
    "I'll need you to protect Rodney and the others while I'm away. Think you can manage it?",
    "It's settled then. Aster, Bill, the Raptor and I will establish an outpost on Ungael[sic]",
    "I never doubted you for a second, Siv.",
    "Let's get going. There's no time to waste.",
    "Almost. I'll head to the boat when I'm ready.",
    "C'mon Bill, we need you.",

    "Or maybe even... prove your dad wrong?",
    "Thanks, Father.",

    "Keep your weapons ready. There's no telling what-",
    "I should speak to the other expedition members before heading into the ruins.",
    "I can feel an ancient power emanating from the tower at the peak of the island. Necrotic power.",
    "You're welcome to remain by the boat if you'd prefer.",
    "Might be handy to have someone here to protect it, if more undead show up.",
    "There's no time for sightseeing. We need to get to the tower.",
    "There! Beneath the ice.",
    "Zemouregal...",
    "Seems we'll have to fight our way through.",
    "For Fort Forinthry!",
    "Necrotic energy is like any source of power, it can be used for both ill and good.",
    "I may be able to use my knowledge of Necromancy to disrupt the ritual.",
    "In doing so, I can siphon a portion of the energy released in order to empower us.",
    "It wasn't your fault. You couldn't have known what she had planned.",
    "Stay focused. We need to find a way off this island.",
    "It's true. You allowed her to manipulate you and jeopardised everything we have worked for.",
    "But the responsibility of stopping Zemouregal does not rest on your shoulders alone.",
    "Come, we should investigate the rest of these ruins. There must be something here.",
    "It doesn't seem to have enough magic to function at the moment. Maybe there's something nearby that will help.",
    "It doesn't seem to have enough magic to function at the moment. Maybe there's something nearby that will help.",
    "We need to take this risk. The fort is in danger.",
    "We need to warn the others.",
    "I'll explain later, Siv. Zemouregal is on his way, with an undead dragon at his command.",
    "However, we do have one saving grace. He doesn't know we've managed to return, we may yet have the element of surprise.",
    "There's no time. We'll have to make do with what we have.",
    "If there is anyone who wishes to leave, I won't hold it against you. Now is your chance.",
    "Thank you.",
    "We may not share blood, but we share a common goal. We want to see this fort succeed.",
    "Zemouregal. Vorkath. They fly in the face of that goal, and must be stopped.",
    "They aren't just a threat to us. They won't stop at the fort. If we fall, they will ravage Varrock. Then all of Misthalin. Perhaps even the kingdoms beyond.",
    "We WILL stop them. We have to!",
    "Just remember, you're not alone. We will face them together. And we WILL defeat them.",
    "For Fort Forinthry!",

    "I'm glad you have faith in us, Father.",

    "Good idea. Extra ranged support will be handy in the coming days.",
    "I know. But we'll be ready.",
