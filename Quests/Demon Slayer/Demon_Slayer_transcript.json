  "Gideon Bede": [
    "In the name of Saradomin, I beseech you - assist me! I have come to this place seeking a dangerous fugitive. He has stolen a formidable demonic tome; one that could spell the end of this entire city. Help me to stop him - please!",
    "You'll help? Praise Saradomin! I knew you looked righteous! We don't have much time, so listen carefully. I am pursuing Denath, a dangerous and unstable wizard. Denath infiltrated Edgeville monastery and stole a tome of demonology from my order. The book was once used to summon Delrith, an ancient demon, from the Infernal Dimensions. Delrith has the power to demolish cities, and is impervious to all forms of attack, save one - the holy sword Silverlight. Silverlight rests in the crypt beneath this very church, watched over by the spirits of its former owners. I've tracked Denath to this city, but I lost his trail. While I hunt him down, I need you to retrieve the sword; should Delrith return to this world, Silverlight shall be our only salvation! Climb down the trapdoor to the south to enter the crypt beneath this church, and retrieve Silverlight.",
    "I am Gideon Bede, an occult scholar and caretaker of Edgeville Monastery's modest library. Abbot Langley entrusted the tome of demonology to me. It is my fault that Denath now has it. Though I could not hope to best Denath in battle, it is my duty to try and stop him.",
    "Denath is a mad man who claims to worship Zamorak. Denath revels in destruction, and is blinded by his lust for power. He would call forth a demon that could just as easily kill him and everyone in Varrock as do his bidding. Denath is insane, and to be approached very cautiously.",
    "Delrith is an ancient and powerful demon. This is not the first time he has entered our world. 150 years ago, a legendary hero battled Delrith, and banished him back to Infernus.",
    "Silverlight is the only weapon that can harm Delrith, and is interred within the crypt beneath this very church. We must secure Silverlight in case the worst should come to pass!",
    "I tried, but the holy sword is guarded by the spirits of the dead - three brave souls that wielded Silverlight in life. I faced the spirits' trials, but was judged unworthy. I am but an academic. I cannot stop Denath without your help, hero.",
    "Alas, then all is lost, and Varrock shall burn...",
    "Climb down the trapdoor to the south to enter the crypt beneath this church, and retrieve Silverlight.",
    "Take care, hero. This place is likely crawling with Denath's fanatics.",
    "I know. It was returned to me. This time, take better care of it.",
    "Take care, hero. I fear our greatest challenge is yet to come.",
    "Not now, adventurer! We must stop Denath!",
    "That takes care of them! Let's move on!",
    "Is there no end to these extremists? Quickly, we must press on.",
    "That's the last of them. Hurry; find Denath before it's too late!",
    "Denath! Stop!",
    "No!",
    "I hope you brought Silverlight, hero! Steel yourself!",
    "Saradomin; shield us!",
    "Aaaaah!",
    "I must rest to shield us again!",
    "Hero! Slay Delrith, now!",
    "He's charging another attack!",
    "Hero, to me!",
    "Saradomin; shield us!",
    "Aaaaah!",
    "Delrith is defeated, but this place is coming apart! Let's get out of here!",
    "Well done, hero. Your actions saved not only myself, but all of Varrock, from being turned to smouldering ash by Delrith!",
    "Return when you have space for five items, and I will reward you for your help!",
    "Here - you've certainly earned this!",
    "I know. It was returned to me. This time, take better care of it.",
    "I'm relieved that barrier I conjured actually worked. I never imagined I might have to protect us from a real demon! Farewell, my friend. Saradomin watch over you."

    "Stealing the earthly possessions of the dead is not a purpose worthy of wielding Silverlight.",
