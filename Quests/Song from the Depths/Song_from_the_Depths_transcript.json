    "Wake up, Waylan. Wake up! Come on, you great drunken oaf. This isn't funny.",
    "No. Everything is not okay. I can't wake any of these men up. They keep muttering things - strangely similar things - as though they're all sharing the same dream. Makes no sense.",
    "No, I can't. I can't wake any of them up. They just lie there. They keep muttering things - strangely similar things - as though they're all sharing the same dream.",
    "I've heard rumours of men affected like this. Lulled into sleep by a strange force, never to awaken again. They just lie there, empty, as though their soul just upped and left somewhere. I don't know what to do. That's my husband there; my Waylan. I don't know what I'd do without him.",
    "Well, I ain't going to turn you down. Anything to get my Waylan back. I should warn you, though; a warrior named the Raptor came here before you and 'offered' to help. He terrified me. I'm not ashamed to admit it. I...gave him a Restless Sleep potion; an old recipe I learned from a witch some time ago. She said it would let me 'visit the world of dreams' - whatever that means. He drank it and then seemed to fade away to somewhere else. You'll need to drink it as well if you want to catch up with him. I'm not afraid to say that I fear the Raptor. You hear stories about him. His solution for a problem is to destroy everything linked to it. That's not who I want saving my husband. Protect my Waylan, would you? I know he's a drunkard, but he's MY drunkard.",
    "I understand.",
    "You'll need this if you want to follow the Raptor and Waylan. If it has the effect I think it will, you'll enter some kind of dream world. Then make sure you get to Waylan before the Raptor does.",
    "Back so soon? Everything alright?",
    "You must still be sleepy. You were following the Raptor and bringing back my Waylan. Go get my drunkard for me, would you?",
    "You already have the potion. You don't need any more.",
    "Careful now: this stuff can be dangerous.",
    "I cannot thank you enough. Waylan's a little groggy, but that's no different after a normal night's drinking.",
    "Quiet, Waylan. The adventurer doesn't need to hear your drunken ramblings. We're in your debt. And you can be sure that I won't let him drink ever again.",
    "Oh! Hello again.",
    "We're doing fine. I can't thank you enough for rescuing Waylan.",

    "This story starts under the sea, in the home of my sisters. In that home, I found moments to sing. But I knew, if my sisters heard me, they would roll up some kelp and force it into my mouth. So, I learned to sing quietly. One night, my sisters were out hunting. I swam from my home and came upon a village on the edge of the sea. There were so many people on the docks, working and talking, but they could not see me in the dark water. So, I sang to them...",
    "Come to me, my men. Gather to hear my story.",
    "So, I sang an old mermaid song, and the men on the docks listened.",

    "The sailors on the dock heard my song, and I could see the adoration on their faces. I drank it all in. But then they stepped into the sea. None of the men made an effort to swim, and they drowned. I lifted the dead bodies back onto the land. I could barely swim home with the sorrow. My sisters taunted me. Even the town changed its name to Witchaven, as if to remind me of what I had done.",
    "I knew I should mourn those men. But I could only think of their adoring looks and the effect they had on me.",
    "So, I swam for the town again. This time, I climbed onto the land and sang for the men of the fields.",
    "There was no water to drown in, and they looked at me with such love...",
    "But then the men saw one another. They became jealous.",
    "And they fought. They hacked at each other, beating flesh and bones with rocks.",
    "As I learned new songs, I found I could affect men in other ways.",
    "One song allowed me to attract the souls of dreaming men. They would love me, even as they slept.",
    "Night or day, I was surrounded by those who loved me, and I loved them back.",
    "I found myself walking the world, sharing the love of dreaming souls.",
    "It was overpowering. It came so easy to me. But, one day, I came across a soul that would not love me.",
    "A furious soul. It burned with rejection, fear, and hatred. It ignored me.",
    "I approached the furious soul. It screamed as if on fire. I tried to soothe it with song, but still it seethed.",
    "So, I cried a tear, and the water extinguished the fire.",
    "I approached the furious soul. It screamed as if on fire. I tried to soothe it with song, but still it seethed. So, I cried a tear, and the water extinguished the fire.",
