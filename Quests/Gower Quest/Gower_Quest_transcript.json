    "Andrew Gower": [
        "Who are you?",
        "Anyway, welcome to the Gower Farm. I'm Andrew.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes!",
        "Yes! We have successfully grown cabbages in the past you know.",
        "We've had word from other cabbage enthusiasts that it's been affecting their farming patches as well.",
        "Do you know how to speak cabbage?",
        "I think it would be more fun to let you figure it out. Quests are better that way!",
        "We're making a new world! A world of cabbages, where the magic of vegetables never ends!",
        "I use cabbagemancy to grant sentience and mobility to the cabbages.",
        "Well, it's a landscape filled with cabbages, so I named it... Cabbagemud!",
        "It's quite a muddy landscape.",
        "Hello again.",
        "Didn't I say it would be better to figure it out for yourself?",
        "Good. Quests are better that way. Besides, you have your quest journal.",
        "Party hats? What?",
        "But that makes no sense. Party hats are just worthless pieces of paper.",
        "It looks like you've lost those party hats. Talk to Ian and he can give you some more.",
        "Hello?",
        "Hello?",
        "Oh, is that all? I can give you one of those.",
        "It's a good thing I built a 'return to owner' function then. Here you go..."
    ],
    "Player": [
        "I'm Player. I was wondering if you had any quests for me?",
        "I'm not just any adventurer. I'm the world guardian!",
        "What do you mean it's stopped working?",
        "Did you rake the plot properly?",
        "Did you put compost down?",
        "Did you plant the seeds?",
        "Did you water them?",
        "Sorry, that's the extent of my farming knowledge.",
        "Do you have any suggestions?",
        "What is it?",
        "That sounds easy. What's the catch?",
        "No...",
        "What should I do?",
        "What's a cabbagemancer?",
        "But what do you do specifically?",
        "A new world? How are you doing that?",
        "What's this world called?",
        "Cabbagemud? Not... Cabbagescape?",
        "Yes.",
        "Oh, go on!",
        "Why?",
        "What happened to that?",
        "That sounds exciting. How did that go?",
        "...",
        "Do you ever not think about cabbages?",
        "What's the story about?",
        "Brassica Prime? Lord of all cabbages?",
        "But Brassica Prime is real!",
        "Oh...",
        "This all sounds very exciting!",
        "I made a cabbagespeak amulet!",
        "Not yet.",
        "Hello?",
        "Hello?",
        "Er...yes? I think so?",
        "I am an unusually precocious specimen.",
        "I wanted to know why the cabbage patches aren't working.",
        "Maybe...",
        "What are you rioting about? What do you want?",
        "I spoke to the cabbages. They're rioting because they want party hats.",
        "You know, paper crowns like the ones you get in crackers.",
        "Yes!",
        "Can cabbages see colour?",
        "Then pink will do!",
        "No, this is mine!",
        "But it's too big for you!",
        "I'd better try and find some smaller ones before I'm down a few bil.",
        "I should see if I can find some party hats for these cabbages.",
        "I have them here.",
        "Will you help me now?",
        "So, will you help me now?",
        "Yes, cabbages are a cultivar of the species brassica oleracea, a species which also includes vegetables such as...",
        "What, really?",
        "Other place? What other place?",
        "Under the cabbage patch? Can we dig down into it?",
        "That sounds like something Andrew Gower might have.",
        "The cabbages told me that to find out why the cabbage patches aren't working I need an item. I just can't remember what it was...",
        "The cabbages told me that to find out why the cabbage patches aren't working I need an item. I just can't remember what it was...",
        "The cabbages told me that to find out why the cabbage patches aren't working I need a Disk of Returning, whatever that is.",
        "The cabbages told me that to find out why the cabbage patches aren't working I need a Disk of Returning, whatever that is.",
        "The cabbages told me that to find out why the cabbage patches aren't working I need a Disk of Returning, whatever that is.",
        "How do you know we need to go there?",
        "Oh, clever.",
        "Well yes, I was just wondering if one of you could teleport me there.",
        "Well, so I don't get confused, and therefore frustrated, and give up partway through the quest...",
        "I, er, I lost my cabbage.",
        "Still working on it.",
        "I lost the disk of returning you gave me...",
        "Where is it?",
        "Here goes nothing...",
        "What do I do now?",
        "Welcome to where?",
        "I don't understand...",
        "I'm not any of those things. I'm an adventurer.",
        "-PLACEHOLDER- hilarious placeholder dialogue here",
        "Wait, what? Why did I say that?",
        "-PLACEHOLDER- the player still doesn't understand",
        "Yuck! That feels horrible!",
        "So... what is this place?",
        "I'm from Gielinor.",
        "I've never noticed this happening.",
        "No. What's Rat Pits?",
        "But what does that have to do with this place?",
        "So it's full of dead people?",
        "What is?",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Maybe you and that other guy whatsisname[sic] just look really similar? It's not like the humans in this game are that distinct from each other.",
        "I'm going to walk away now.",
        "Hey Bandos, where's your head at?",
        "...",
        "Sorry.",
        "Information.",
        "What do you have?",
        "I'm sorry?",
        "I'm not sure what conversation I've just got into here but I think I already regret it.",
        "Uh.",
        "...",
        "Sorry, what?",
        "You're waiting to be done? What will you be when you're done?",
        "Shoot for the moon, half-finished weird blue man thing.",
        "Didn't you mean to say, the DJ is a spider?",
        "How could I do such a thing?",
        "No, I mean, your Attack option isn't set, so I couldn't attack you even if I wanted to, or even by mistake when I meant to pickpocket you.",
        "You also don't have a Pick-pocket option, don't worry.",
        "Hello, Mod Raven. Can I get the Ravensworn title without searching the elf city?",
        "That's not what I...",
        "This is just getting silly now...",
        "Yeah, whatever. Bye.",
        "Yes, oh great lord Raven. To be in your presence is an honour beyond reproach.",
        "Hail Mod Raven.",
        "You're being very familiar.",
        "Oh, you're not?",
        "Who are you then?",
        "Oh, like a parallel world?",
        "What's the one crucial difference?",
        "Really?",
        "Can you give me an example?",
        "Vaguely yeah.",
        "Why are you here then?",
        "If your world is so perfect, what are you doing here?",
        "So you say.",
        "If you say so.",
        "What's that?",
        "I guess.",
        "You're saying you're bored?",
        "I'm glad we amuse you.",
        "Hello, do I know you?",
        "What, like... Araxxor?",
        "I honestly can't tell which are which, then.",
        "Well, keep up the good work!",
        "Sorry, have we met?",
        "That was you in that thing? Incredible!",
        "Well, keep up the good work!",
        "Jessika?",
        "Hang on, I remember you were there during that business with Nomad - aren't you only supposed to be here if you're dead?",
        "Well, yes, but you went to the Underworld, so you're sort of still around...?",
        "Wate wut.",
        "...okay...",
        "Jessika?",
        "I'm sorry I let you die.",
        "What?",
        "Korasi?",
        "Hang on, I remember you were there during that business with Nomad - aren't you only supposed to be here if you're dead?",
        "Well, yes, but you went to the Underworld, so you're sort of still around...?",
        "Wate wut.",
        "...okay...",
        "Korasi?",
        "I'm sorry I let you die.",
        "What?",
        "Are you pretending to be an Ent?",
        "You're not skinny enough for an Ent. Besides, Mod Osborne made us take out all the explicit references to that film about the one ring... you know?",
        "Yeah that one!",
        "To be honest I'm pretty confused by this place, but everyone seems friendly enough.",
        "Who are you talking about?",
        "Wait...but aren't you Zanik?",
        "I'm not mocking you, I just don't understand.",
        "I'll just leave you to it.",
        "So, what do we do now that we're here?",
        "I shouldn't go wandering through portals until I know what I'm hoping to find the other side.",
        "What?",
        "How could you know that?",
        "Oh, I must have you confused with someone else. Weird that I'd bring it up.",
        "Cabbage patch.",
        "You're Minstrel Web, you did that sweet set at Death's house a few years back!",
        "Yeah, but you were a bit terse with me, to be honest.",
        "So you're calling yourself Spiral Orb now? You seem to be talking a bit differently too.",
        "Cabbage patch.",
        "The life altar?",
        "The legendary life altar is in the basement?!",
        "Actually I never write anything down. My quest journal just seems to remember everything for me.",
        "I have no idea! I think it might be space magic.",
        "Who is Lucien?",
        "Let's pretend for sake of argument that I haven't looked up the backstory online. Could you describe him to me?",
        "I'm sure I'll recognise him.",
        "Oh yeah, Lucien. Big guy, skull face, big bendy stick?",
        "Steve?",
        "Oh no, the chaos elemental?",
        "Only by reputation. Isn't he that guy who talks total gibberish?",
        "Well I'll do my best.",
        "Thok?",
        "What's a viking?",
        "Could you describe him?",
        "Okay, thok you, I mean thank you.",
        "Funny, for some reason I was expecting four.",
        "You mean one fewer.",
        "One fewer, not one less. The pieces are discrete and countable.",
        "Oh, I must have you confused with someone else. Weird that I'd bring it up.",
        "You're Minstrel Web, you did that sweet set at Death's house a few years back!",
        "Yeah, but you were a bit terse with me, to be honest.",
        "So you're calling yourself Spiral Orb now? You seem to be talking a bit differently too.",
        "No, sorry.",
        "Oh, no way, that was you two?",
        "Were you... this tall at the time?",
        "So what do you do here?",
        "What?",
        "What is an environment lead? Is that some sort of petrol pollution thing?",
        "Oh sorry, it can be difficult to tell without voice acting. What does an environment lead do?",
        "Cool!",
        "So you're a bit like construction foremen?",
        "WAZZZZZZZZUP!",
        "No, I'll figure it out for myself.",
        "Guthix, it's so good to see you again.",
        "What do you mean?",
        "But-",
        "Er, not really.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Gotten used to what?",
        "Oh yeah, didn't they remove you from the game because you were too blatant a reference?",
        "Why do you think there are so many references in the game?",
        "Oh, like homages?",
        "What's the bad reason?",
        "Hm?",
        "You must hate this quest then!",
        "You've put a lot of thought into this.",
        "Oh, well, thanks for nothing then.",
        "Oh, thanks.",
        "Oh, who are you?",
        "What is that?",
        "Ah, that sounds useful for a spy!",
        "Have we met? Who are you?",
        "Is the beard relevant?",
        "Well... thanks.",
        "Well, according to my backstory, you're like some kind of ultimate villain or something, but uh, I don't really remember any of that.",
        "Sixth Age?",
        "I think so.",
        "Oh yeah?",
        "Alright, thanks for the recommendation.",
        "Know each other? You killed my friends!",
        "When you stole the Stone of Jas and tried to use it to become a god!",
        "And While Guthix Sleeps, you monster!",
        "Of course I do! Your arrogance brought down the wrath of the dragonkin!",
        "Good times? My friends are dead!",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes...",
        "Hazelmere's alive?",
        "I see.",
        "The Sixth Age?",
        "I guess.",
        "That's right! That's just the sort of thing I do.",
        "You lost it?",
        "Someone stole it from you?",
        "The bank?",
        "Oh yes, I have one of those. Mine is full of junk to be honest. I really ought to clean it out.",
        "I will! Good idea.",
        "So I need to find the bank pin?",
        "Whose bank is it? Who stole it from you?",
        "The Wise Old Man? The notorious bank robber?",
        "How ironic.",
        "Where's the bank?",
        "Thanks!",
        "You said the life altar fragment's in the Wise Old Man's bank, right?",
        "So on it.",
        "But I haven't given you my name yet!",
        "But I am authorised personnel.",
        "What kind of name is Steve?",
        "I'm Player.",
        "I didn't mean to insult you, I just meant... Steve sounds quite a mundane name for a chaos elemental.",
        "Yes, that's more what I was expecting!",
        "So what do you do, Steve?",
        "What?",
        "Oh, like a fortune teller?",
        "I think I might have read some of your stuff on the website.",
        "Yes, but I can't understand a word of it. I was surprised you were so comprehensible in person.",
        "Oh, why is that?",
        "Oh, you're into fashionscape?",
        "Great! Where is it?",
        "The Grand Exchange?",
        "Oh yeah, that Grand Exchange.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Thanks.",
        "But Thok... this is where removed content goes to drink. You haven't been removed, have you?!",
        "Then what are you doing here?",
        "Thok, when we're on the surface world I know I won't have the courage to say this. But Thok... did you ever know that you're my hero? You're everything I wish I could be.",
        "No Thok, listen. You're the meaning in my life. You're the inspiration.",
        "You know it's true, everything I do, I do it for you.",
        "Good. I just wanted to let you know.",
        "The life altar, Thok. I need to fix it.",
        "It's like... a big rock... with a picture on it. It exploded.",
        "Do you know where any of the pieces of it went?",
        "Where is that?",
        "Okay, I'll go find and talk to Max.",
        "Sk\u00e5l!",
        "Bye Thok!",
        "Break into a bank.",
        "Quest says I have to.",
        "Nope.",
        "I need to blow open a vault door.",
        "Why am I not surprised? What is it this time? You want me to fetch you some shoes? You want me to polish all your belt buckles? You want me to dance for you like a ballerina?",
        "That does sound hard.",
        "Let me guess. You want me to take a cup of tea to each of the five environment artists hanging around the bar?",
        "I assume I can buy tea from the bartenders?",
        "Is there some reason the environment artists can't get their own free tea from the bartenders they're standing right next to?",
        "And you can't do it because...?",
        "Right. I'll get on with it...",
        "I need to break into a bank. Can you help?",
        "Well, there's a guard that needs distracting.",
        "I'm stealing back something that was stolen, which I need to save the world... sort of.",
        "What do you want?",
        "Oh, you want a job?",
        "Thanks anyway.",
        "Rob a bank.",
        "It's super important.",
        "I need someone to distract the female receptionist.",
        "Of course there is. What is it?",
        "Can't you do it yourself?",
        "Should they be lovers, not fighters?",
        "Anything else?",
        "Those are quite specific criteria.",
        "Good thing the God Wars bosses are standing at a table over there.",
        "I need someone with a very particular set of skills...",
        "Yes, actually!",
        "Don't you want to know what the job is?",
        "Don't you want me to do something for you in return?",
        "Of course there is.",
        "I don't see why not. You're the least awkward person I've met so far on this quest.",
        "I wonder who that was?",
        "Well, I need X cups of tea to give people...",
        "Hey, thanks!",
        "Is something the matter?",
        "You can't find an actor to play the role of Guthix?",
        "It's funny you should say that. I think I may have the perfect person for you.",
        "I represent a distinguished actor who not only has decades of experience on stage and screen, he has literally spent his lifetime perfecting the role of Guthix.",
        "I'll let him know.",
        "Not yet.",
        "Yes, the cabbages are performing what promises to be an absolutely unique interpretation of that classic 'Put Those Edicts Back Where They Came From... Or So Help Me'. Based on my recommendation, they want to offer you the leading role. This could be huge. It could go international!",
        "Oh, I thought you were sleeping somewhere near Ardougne.",
        "I still need your help with the bank job.",
        "Could I trouble you for some romantic advice? It's for a friend of course.",
        "Could I trouble you for some romantic advice.[sic] It's for a friend of course.",
        "Could I trouble you for some romantic advice? It's for a friend of course.",
        "Could I trouble you for some romantic advice? It's for a friend of course.",
        "Could I trouble you for some romantic advice? It's for a friend of course.",
        "Ok so, apparently-",
        "...",
        "Of course! It comes from ideal sources.",
        "Yes!",
        "I need you to distract that receptionist so I can break into the bank without her watching.",
        "I need that guard to abandon his post. Think you can handle it?",
        "Hi.",
        "Have you met my friend?",
        "The complex gender roles at work in that scene make my head spin!",
        "I didn't expect that to work.",
        "Wait, who are you?",
        "Oh, that's convenient. I need someone to help me crack a safe.",
        "Wait, who are you?",
        "Did I?",
        "Oh, okay.",
        "Er, I guess, Mr Mystery Penguin.",
        "Like this?",
        "Seriously? That was it?",
        "Wait, who are you?",
        "...hey, the safe's open! That's handy.",
        "I got a fragment from the bank.",
        "Yep.",
        "I got the fragment out of the GE.",
        "I got the one from the GE installed.",
        "Where is he again?",
        "Okay, I'll go find him.",
        "Sk\u00e5l!",
        "Bye Thok!",
        "I think I ought to talk to Max about all this first...",
        "Oh, hey Max, it's me, the world guardian!",
        "What?",
        "So what are you doing here, Max?",
        "Is that why it looks all broken and unfinished?",
        "But that's cheating!",
        "Then why do you do it?",
        "Thok told me there was a fragment of the life altar in here. Have you seen it? I need it.",
        "Great! Will you give it to me?",
        "What if I promise I would?",
        "Max all of them? But that will take forever!",
        "Okay, what skills do I need to do?",
        "Go on, give me a clue.",
        "Like what?",
        "What? What are they?",
        "What are the skills? Tell me?",
        "JUST TELL ME!",
        "YES!",
        "Bankstanding?",
        "I... was not expecting that. What else?",
        "Yes!",

The Titan killed the old cabbagemancer to lure me here and that let the life altar get out of control. What do you think about staying here as caretakers?

I've run this sort of thing with lots of cabbages, and what I've found is that the more information I give them up front the less interested they are. The ideal balance is a limited area with a specific objective and the freedom to experiment. So enjoy!",
        "I'm making up this game so the cabbages don't get bored! They pretend to be heroes and then I tell them a story about a situation they're in, and then they tell me what they do, and I tell them whether it worked. I call it 'rollplaying' because the cabbages have to roll themselves in order to determine the outcome.",

        "Anyway, while Brassica Prime slept, the immortal, alien Rutabagarat came to Cabbanor from another world! Their devious schemes still threaten to undermine all of cabbagedom. My latest quest is called 'Ritual of the Rutabagarat'. The heroes have revived Neepanadra from his long slumber, but will Luswedien use the power of the Stone of Yams to become a god? And what part have the mysterious Carrotkin to play?",
        "It is, but I'll be honest, some of the cabbages don't really care about the story. They just want to roll around and get experience points. But for me the story is where the REAL magic is. It transforms this simple farm into an incredible world where anything can happen. The cabbages can be heroes. They can be anything. Sometimes I think it's a better world. Better than this one.",
