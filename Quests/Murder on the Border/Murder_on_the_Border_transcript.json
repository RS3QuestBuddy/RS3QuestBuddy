    "Greetings, your grace.",
    "Your grace, we have received an urgent request from the king.",
    "Indeed it is. Alas, I must warn you, the nature of this request may be distressing.",
    "King Roald requests we host a banquet at Fort Forinthry to commemorate your appointment as a [title].",
    "The royal family will be in attendance, as well as select members of the nobility.",
    "Pardon me your grace, but have you met the other dukes and duchesses? The Misthalinian nobility?",
    "Or the queen, for that matter...",
    "It is customary for all newly appointed nobles of your station to do so.",
    "Still, the political machinations of the nobility are not a matter to be taken lightly.",
    "Be prepared for backstabbing, betrayal, underhanded deals and a plethora of sarcastic jabs and passive aggressive remarks!",
    "I suppose such antics are commonplace for one with as colourful a past as yourself.",
    "I can't deny the appeal. The thrill of political intrigue, seduction, ambition and scandal does pique my interest.",
    "It's the backdrop of volumes twelve through seventeen of 'Murder in Ardougne'! The best mystery series in Gielinor, I'll have you know.",
    "Hopefully our soir\u00e9e involves less bloodshed than the one in volume fourteen...",
    "With your leadership, I'm confident it shall.",
    "Exactly. This banquet is our formal introduction to Misthalin's political landscape. It must be flawless.",
    "I'm content leaving that manner of entertainment to my books.",
    "There are several preparations that must be made in order for us to accommodate a banquet of this magnitude.",
    "We will need to construct a kitchen for the fort, recruit a building manager and gather supplies.",
    "Speak with Bill. I believe he has plans for a kitchen extension to the town hall.",
    "I shall look into recruiting a building manager for the new kitchen and direct our staff to gather produce from the local area.",
    "Understood. But I would ask that we discuss this matter at your earliest convenience.",
    "Greetings, your grace.",
    "Greetings, your grace.",
    "Greetings, your grace.",
    "I shall look into recruiting a building manager for the new kitchen while you handle the construction.",
    "I have also sent our staff to gather what produce they can find in the local area.",
    "Greetings, your grace.",
    "I have contacted several promising candidates for the new building manager position. Might I recommend my sister, Bianca?",
    "She is a highly skilled cook, having worked for the Varrock palace in the past. She is able to arrive in time for the feast.",
    "Marvellous. Our staff have been scouring the local area for produce. There is little edible here, but we have a few options.",
    "There is poisonous hollyhock gathered from the local fauna and a large quantity of meat of dubious origin.",
    "Gifts of food and drink are customary, so what we have gathered thus far should suffice.",
    "I took the liberty of sending invitations ahead of time.",
    "Meet me by the front gates when you are ready to greet our guests.",
    "Greetings, your grace.",
    "You should find means to continue our soir\u00e9e in the courtyard, your grace.",
    "We are all prepared to start the banquet, your grace.",
    "I believe I hear the king's retinue approaching. They should be here in but a moment...",
    "Introducing King Roald Remanis III of Misthalin and Queen Ellamaria.",
    "We do not currently have any troops stationed here, your majesty.",
    "May I ask who accompanies you this evening?",
    "Please, make your way inside. The other guests will join us shortly.",
    "And our new kitchen manager should be here any second...",
    "Introducing our new kitchen manager and my dear sister: Bianca.",
    "It certainly has. How are you faring, Bee?",
    "What happened?",
    "Bee is one of the best cooks in Misthalin. This banquet will go swimmingly.",
    "In the meantime, I believe we have more guests approaching...",
    "Introducing Duke Cole Hoarse, Lord Rodney Midas and... 'Princess'?",
    "Welcome to Fort Forinthry, your grace. I-",
    "I suggest you join the king and queen inside the townhall. Our final arrival should be here any moment.",
    "Introducing our final guest, Duchess Hyett of Lumford.",
    "You are the last to arrive, your grace. Our other guests are already inside.",
    "O-oh! I...fear that wouldn't be in keeping with the spirit of the banquet, your grace.",
    "That is the last of our guests. Do not say I didn't warn you.",
    "I trust that you are not including me in that, your grace.",
    "Bianca and myself will prepare the feast. I advise you take this opportunity to converse with our guests.",
    "Remember, all eyes are upon us. This is our formal introduction to the Misthalinian political scene.",
    "To put it plainly, don't mess it up!",
    "His majesty is unable to consume the entr\u00e9e Duchess Alba brought, therefore-",
    "Pardon me, your grace, but the dish does not have-",
    "Please allow me to fulfil his request, your grace. If this is what the good duke wants, we will accommodate him.",
    "By all means, your grace. The good duke shall have what he requests.",
    "Sincerest apologises, your grace. We will see it done.",
    "Try to acquaint yourself with each of our guests, if possible. Strong first impressions are vital.",
    "You will find King Roald, Queen Ellamaria and Lady Ruthven on the balcony above us, up the stairs.",
    "The feast is ready to be served. Shall I call our guests to the table?",
    "Agreed. No-one can be allowed to leave or enter Fort Forinthry until we uncover what happened here. And whomever is responsible.",
    "We must lock down the fort. No-one can be allowed to leave or enter Fort Forinthry until we uncover what happened here. And whomever is responsible.",
    "If the duke was indeed poisoned...the only people with access to the meal or his person are in this very room.",
    "Each of you ate the same banquet as him, did you not?",
    "We have a murderer in our midst. Of that, I am certain.",
    "It would appear my many years of experience analysing mystery novels may be put to practical use.",
    "Together, I'm confident we can solve this heinous crime.",
    "Yes, you're right. This isn't fiction- it is a serious crime. I apologise for indulging in a flight of fancy.",
    "Still, I shall endeavour to be the best assistant I can in this investigation.",
    "O-of course, your grace. Still, I shall endeavour to be the best assistant I can in this investigation.",
    "Our suspects...pardon me, our guests, have disseminated throughout the fort. Though it took some convincing on Rodney's part.",
    "'Interrogate' carries strong connotations, but I would deem some questioning appropriate, given the events that have unfolded.",
    "Additionally, there is surely evidence pertaining to the crime scattered across the grounds of the fort.",
    "It is rather embarrassing, but I happen to possess a 'mystery journal' I used to solve mysteries as a child.",
    "Perhaps it will assist us in keeping track of the various clues and information we discover.",
    "You do not appear to have space for it on your person at the moment. Please make room in your backpack.",
    "We need to figure out who was responsible for killing Duke Hoarse by collecting clues.",
    "You can use the mystery journal I gave you to track how many clues you have found, and how many are left to find.",
    "Based on my extensive murder mystery knowledge, we should be able to find some clues on the grounds of the fort and some by speaking to the suspects.",
    "You can also link certain clues to the suspects. Linking a clue to the correct person will unlock further clues.",
    "Simon wrote instructions detailing how to create poison detection potions in the mystery journal. We should brew some and test the duke's meal to find out what was responsible for killing him.",
    "I am quite fond of reading in general, your grace. The intrigue and compelling drama of mystery novels just happens to make them my favourite.",
    "The 'Draynor Mysteries' series in particular has the distinction of being what inspired me to become a steward.",
    "I was...an outcast, as a child. Aside from my dear sister, reading was my one escape from the cruelty of the world.",
    "The steward in 'Draynor Mysteries' was charismatic, respected, helpful. I strived to be that.",
    "The aesthetic also appeals to me.",
    "Let us continue our investigation.",
    "The duke was an unpleasant man, but he did not deserve this.",
    "Be careful. It is highly likely that a portion of the duke's meal was poisoned.",
    "With the instructions Simon gave us we should be able to determine if a portion of the duke's meal was poisoned.",
    "Is that jewellery I spot? What is it doing inside this half-buried box?",
    "We should ask around.",
    "One cannot ignore the possibility that there was foul play involved with this gift.",
    "Indeed. I can assure you that it is not part of my collection.",
    "A red herring, perhaps? Or a plant... whatever the case, finding the owner only serves to benefit us.",
    "Perhaps that is not the wisest thing to announce at this time, your grace.",
    "A page also seems to have been torn out...how peculiar.",
    "In the notes it says that we need to add a trace amount of the poisonous substance we want the potion to detect before heating it.",
    "It was due to 'creative differences', if I recall correctly?",
    "Your dancing is marvellous, Bee. I remember when we would dance in the creek behind our cottage as children.",
    "...",
    "We were raised in Lumford. It is a lovely town, and her grace always went above and beyond for us.",
    "I suspect the [title] is already aware of that.",
    "Did you notice anything else? Any of the other guests acting strangely? Anything that seemed out of place?",
    "Was there anything unusual about the p\u00e2t\u00e9?",
    "If I may be so bold, what is troubling you, your majesty?",
    "If only we could understand what she is saying.",
    "Do you suspect Lord Rodney?",
    "Pardon me, your majesty, but that sounds dreadful. Every life taken is a tragedy.",
    "I'm sorry Lord Rodney, truly, but we cannot risk someone tampering with the body.",
    "And several of your spouses lives appear to have been cut tragically short. One cannot help but speculate that you were responsible.",
    "If what you say is true then perhaps it would be in the people's best interests for you to remained unwed.",
    "Not checking the food as well somewhat defeats the purpose, does it not?",
    "Anything, you say?",
    "According to Simon's instructions we first need to add a small amount of the poisonous substance we are attempting to detect to the base potion.",
    "This potion is unfinished. According to Simon's instructions we need to apply heat to activate it.",
    "Might I suggest the range in the kitchen?",
    "Nothing happened. Perhaps we should use a different combination?",
    "Nothing happened. Perhaps we should use a different combination?",
    "It's bubbling, as described in Simon's notes!",
    "Nothing happened. Perhaps we should use a different combination?",
    "I shall ensure that poisonous p\u00e2t\u00e9 is disposed of post-haste.",
    "I believe we have uncovered all we can for now. Let us discuss our findings in private.",
    "We should be able to discuss our findings in private here.",
    "Either he is lying to us or he was set up.",
    "I would never have dreamt that she would resort to-",
    "I am unharmed, your grace. Fortunately our assailant merely incapacitated me.",
    "This is just like that scene in 'Mute Witness' where-",
    "Ah, that reminds me! We should inspect the assassin's body for evidence.",
    "We should inspect the assassin's body for evidence.",
    "'Remember, we need the steward alive'...what do I have to do with this?",
    "And it says 'I'll open the gates'...",
    "Leave this unsightliness to me, your grace. I'll get it tidied away soon enough.",
    "No...I don't believe that is possible. They had no access to his meal, and were preoccupied fighting the [title] when the gates were opened.",
    "One would hope I was never a prime suspect to begin with.",
    "Though given the frequency at which stewards are responsible for such crimes in fiction I understand the suspicion.",
    "Was one of our guests attempting to destroy evidence?",
    "Someone was trying to destroy it! But why?",
    "This iconography...I can't say I've ever seen anything quite like it.",
    "We need to figure out who was responsible for killing Duke Hoarse by collecting clues.",
    "You can use the mystery journal I gave you to track how many clues you have found, and how many are left to find.",
    "Based on my extensive murder mystery knowledge, we should be able to find some clues on the grounds of the fort and some by speaking to the suspects.",
    "You can also link certain clues to the suspects. Linking a clue to the correct person will unlock further clues.",
    "We should ask Queen Ellamaria if what Lord Rodney said about her being friends with Bianca when she was younger is true.",
    "We should try linking the amulet Lady Ruthven gave us to Princess.",
    "Princess seems to think there are secrets buried throughout the fort. Ask her for directions and see where it leads us.",
    "I have mostly been odd-jobbing, truthfully. As you no doubt noticed when we first met at the Blue Moon Inn.",
    "People are quick to judge. Particularly for one such as myself, who may not fit ones[sic] preconceived image of a steward.",
    "That Bill recommended me for this position is something for which I shall forever be grateful. It is the highest station I have held.",
    "Thank you for entrusting me with it, your grace. I will not squander this opportunity.",
    "I would like to continue referring to you as 'your grace', your grace. If that is acceptable. It feels...right.",
    "Let us continue our investigation.",
    "I cannot believe it escaped my notice that your friend 'Ella' from Varrock was none other than the queen herself!",
    "Did you notice anything out of the ordinary at all?",
    "May I ask what transpired between you and the Remanis family?",
    "Let us leave the duchess alone, your grace. We have already acquired the information we need.",
    "Calm yourself, father. The beasts have long been dealt with.",
    "That is...quite the theory. How did you arrive at this conclusion, pray tell?",
    "We should utilize[sic] the amulet of spanielspeak Lady Ruthven leant[sic] us.",
    "Why was that?",
    "I...do recall Bianca mentioning a friend named 'Ella'.",
    "But it never once occurred to me that said friend was Queen Ellamaria herself!",
    "This could be the breakthrough we have been searching for!",
    "I believe we have discovered all the evidence we can. We should share our findings with King Roald and Queen Ellamaria.",
    "Shall I gather our guests in the courtyard?",
    "As you wish, your grace. It's wise of you to carefully consider all the evidence before making an accusation.",
    "Simon's satchel seems like an appropriate place to start. How did it end up in the courtyard? Why was a page torn out of the book?",
    "That does not align with what we uncovered. Simon claimed that when the king and queen's retinue was attacked, he lost the satchel in the commotion.",
    "If the murderer arrived afterwards, they could have discovered the satchel on their journey.",
    "They likely removed the page detailing how to brew poison detection potions and placed the satchel in the courtyard in an attempt to frame him!",
    "That would make sense if it was Lord Rodney who committed the murder. But I am not convinced...",
    "I do not believe King Roald was their true target. I posit that they knew the king required a custom dish and that Simon only tested his beverages.",
    "But they cannot have expected Duke Hoarse to insist on being served the same dish.",
    "I must have served the poisoned p\u00e2t\u00e9 that was intended to kill King Roald to Duke Hoarse by mistake!",
    "The note we found on their body read: 'remember, we need the steward alive'...why did they need me alive?",
    "Protect me?",
    "I do not see how that could be the case.",
    "What if the purpose of that line was to ensure that I was not harmed in the attack?",
    "But why would the murderer care for my wellbeing?",
    "It is possible that the desired outcome of their crime was not power, or to take revenge on King Roald himself, but to scorn Queen Ellamaria.",
    "She cares for her husband more than anything in the world and the Zamorakians offered the murderer a means of eliminating him.",
    "You know it cannot have been me your grace. I was with you when the assassin attacked! I could not have opened the gate.",
    "You would accuse the king himself? Please rethink this decision, your grace!",
    "You would accuse the queen herself? Please rethink this decision, your grace!",
    "Rodney is certainly a questionable character, but I do not believe he holds any resentment towards the queen.",
    "The duchess definitely has a motive and has made her disdain for the Remanis family clear.",
    "But given the role Zamorakians played in her son's death I cannot envision her working with them willingly.",
    "Lady Ruthven is certainly an enigmatic and suspicious character but I do not see what she had to gain from any of this.",
    "The dog?",
    "Please do not tell me you were persuaded by Lady Ruthven's ludicrous theory...",
    "...",
    "You admitted to finding jewellery belonging to Queen Ellamaria strewn along the King's Road. It stands to reason that you also discovered Simon's satchel.",
    "You know about hollyhock and how to utilize[sic] it in your culinary work. You knew Simon merely tested the king's beverages from your time working at the palace.",
    "That the assassin was ordered not to harm me...your soured relationship with the queen...",
    "I do not want to believe it Bee, but...I cannot deny the evidence.",
    "Better? You murdered two innocent people!",
    "No! Player, please...I know that her crimes cannot be forgiven, nor forgotten. But the punishment for treason is-",
    "Pardon me your grace, but I... I need some time to myself.",
    "Greetings, your grace.",
    "It is good to be back. I see that the post-banquet cleanup has been meticulously executed in my absence.",
    "Well, your grace, all things considered. Please do not worry about me.",
    "It was wonderful to have the opportunity to live out a real murder mystery. Even if the end result was more akin to a nightmare than a dream.",
    "To think that Bee murdered two innocent people. How little I knew about her situation...could I have prevented it getting to this point?",
    "I will miss her.",
    "But I am more than ready to resume my managerial responsibilities here. Speaking of which-.[sic]",
    "Lord Rodney would like to have a word with you. You will find him in the kitchen.",
    "Lord Rodney is waiting for you in the kitchen."

    "If the request is from King Roald it must be important.",
    "What is it?",
    "That doesn't sound particularly distressing.",
    "Why do we need to throw a dinner party for the king again?",
    "I'll speak to Bill then. He should be at the workshop, as usual.",
    "I don't have time for this right now.",
    "Several of the kingdom's nobility will be attending, apparently. As well as the king and queen themselves.",
    "Thanks Bill.",
    "I'll get working on that kitchen.",
    "Sounds good to me.",
    "Let's hope our guests bring additional supplies with them.",
    "Should we be concerned about these cultists targeting the banquet?",

    "What is it about mystery novels that has you so enamoured with them?",
    "Really?",
    "We'll find out who's responsible.",

    "Did you notice anything suspicious in the kitchen?",
    "Did you notice anything suspicious during the banquet?",
    "Is that all you have to say on the matter?",
    "Did you notice anything suspicious this evening?",
    "Don't worry. We'll get to the bottom of this.",
    "Do you know any good rumours about the Misthalinian nobility?",
    "Why was Duke Horacio unable to attend this evening?",
    "Did you notice anything suspicious during the banquet?",
    "Do you know why Duke Hoarse may have been targeted?",
    "Thank you for your time.",
    "Alba doesn't strike me as being particularly cooperative.",
    "You wouldn't happen to have any idea who killed the duke, would you girl?",
    "Did you notice anything suspicious during the banquet?",
    "Thank you for your time.",
    "You seem quite calm given everything that's happened.",
    "[The answer that was selected the first time.]",
    "Did you notice anything suspicious while you were in the kitchen?",
    "Tell me about your relationship with the duke.",
    "You seem to have had many previous marriages.",
    "Did you notice anything suspicious prior to the feast?",
    "You paid a lot of attention to what was going on in the kitchen.",
    "Do you also test the king's food, or are you strictly a wine taster?",
    "Let's check the kitchen.",
    "The duke's p\u00e2t\u00e9 was poisoned using hollyhock. Just as I suspected.",
    "The roof of the townhall seems like a sensible choice. Let's head there.",
    "Simon's satchel was found in the courtyard and contained a suspicious book with one page missing.",
    "He claims he lost it when the king's retinue was attacked along the king's road.",
    "Alba brought the nut roast to the banquet, ensuring that the King required a custom dish. The duke requested it as well, out of jealousy.",
    "It's possible that the plates were mixed up, and the p\u00e2t\u00e9 that killed Duke Hoarse was meant to be served to King Roald.",
    "We also found a hastily buried box containing the queen's jewellery. Bianca admitted to finding it along the King's Road and taking it for herself.",

    "While we were discussing our findings on the roof of the townhall, Aster and myself were beset by an assassin wearing the armour of the king's guard.",
    "Were any of the king's guard unaccounted for?",
    "Aster was with me the entire time. I know they can't have opened the gate.",
    "This note we found on the assassin's body indicates that the person responsible for poisoning the duke opened the gates.",
    "They now have the blood of two people on their hands.",

    "These are the people to whom our king would grant a duchy? How far we have fallen.",
    "It seems the new [title] knows exactly how to respond to your nonsense, Hoarse.",
    "Not bad for someone who was thrown this land by the king, yet offered nary a stone nor hammer to actually build the place.",
    "No, I don't believe I will.",
    "Don't think I've forgotten what you did during the famine. How Lumford's food stores were seized by the capital while our people went hungry.",
    "I apologise profusely for not responding to the demand to surrender half of our grain stores. How dare I.",
    "That's a legitimately impressive tale.",
    "Locking down the fort because the duke choked on his dinner? This is madness!",
    "You seem suspiciously familiar with poison.",
    "And now the late duke has died in equally suspicious circumstances.",
    "Calm down, Lady Ruthven!",
    "Leave me be.",
    "What do you want?",
    "No.",
    "Yes.",
    "We're a small but prosperous duchy, with the most fertile land and beautiful vistas in Misthalin.",
    "Our castle is larger than Horacio's as well!",
    "It is my duty to protect my people, whether that be from those blasted Zamorakians or our fool of a king.",
    "Finally, some peace.",
    "Just how long do you expect us to follow along with this charade?",
    "I, for one, will be in the command centre, enjoying what little peace I can.",
    "Let's get this over with, shall we?",
    "None of your bloody business!",
    "My beef isn't against Roald. Not really.",
    "But his father Roald II and the Remanis family as a whole? Damn them! Damn them all!",
    "My dear Henry. My son...those vile Zamorakians sunk their foul claws into him, twisted his mind.",
    "He was always a sickly boy. An outcast. Easy prey for those wicked people. Got caught up in things he shouldn't have.",
    "King Roald II didn't know the meaning of the word mercy. He decided to 'make an example' of my poor boy.",
    "He was still a child!",
    "It was twenty years ago...to the day. It hasn't become any easier.",
    "If only such words could bring him back. Pardon my candidness, but such sentiments provide me little comfort.",
    "'Shouldn't' and 'can't' are two very different things, [title].",
    "The king is an honest man. He granted me a duchy in honour of my service to his father. To make amends for what transpired back then.",
    "But he will never free himself from his father's actions. Not while he bears his name.",
    "You're asking me to recount the most traumatic experience of my life AGAIN?",
    "Finally, some peace.",
    "But what reason would they have to kill the duke of Edgeville?",
    "Too good for her, in my opinion.",
    "You handled this fiasco decently enough. Perhaps I will be able to tolerate working with you in the future."

    "I may have stolen a bite or two from the kitchen. I know not what this grey slop is, but I know that it's delicious!",
    "You must find the foul cretin who murdered the duke and cast them into the fiery pits of depravity from whence they came!",
    "Vile beasts descend upon us! The end is nigh! Repent, repent!",
    "Such contemptible crimes...that young woman is beyond redemption."
