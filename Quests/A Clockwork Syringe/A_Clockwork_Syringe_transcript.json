    "And you're coming with me.",
    "Now I need to go and warn Bill Teach before it's too late!",
    "Never! You're coming with me to Bill Teach!",
    "Bill, I have urgent news about Ra-- About 'You-Know-Who'.",

    "Hang on, what?",
    "Alright... I guess...",
    "A Long Drop.",
    "Aye, drop me...",
    "Aaaaah!",
    "Why is it that whenever a pirate tells me to go somewhere I end up with a headache?",
    "I've got urgent news about Rabid Jack!",
    "Dammit, Bill! We don't have time for that! Listen to me!",
    "I was attacked in my house by an assassin. Part zombie, part pirate, all mechanical and all evil. He claims he was sent by 'You-Know-Who', and is one of an army being built to attack Mos Le'Harmless!",
    "Yes, I do have... evidence.",
    "Bill?",
    "Well, I was in my house... ...and then I brought his decapitated head here to you.",
    "That's why I brought him here. I subjected him to brutal torture, but he wouldn't give me the location of the factory where the army is being built.",
    "What is it, Bill?",
    "Okay, so you need me to go and pick it up. What am I getting from him? A head vice? Or maybe flesh-eating ants? Ooh, is it hot pokers?",
    "You want me to ask Braindeath for a Twiblik Night Special?",
    "What is it?",
    "Wow, that's handy. Thanks Bill!",
    "What was that?",
    "What was I supposed to be doing again?",
    "Right. I\u2019ll be on my way. You two enjoy your date!",
    "Nothing. I'll be on my way.",
    "Ow!",
    "I'm here on behalf of Bill Teach. We have an urgent situation unfolding, and he has asked that I requisition...",
    "...",
    "...the Twiblik Night Special.",
    "You don't seem too pleased to be telling me about this.",
    "How long have the brewers been missing for? Where were they last seen?",
    "Hmmm, so if I rescue these brewers, you'll prepare the Twiblik Night Special for me to take to Bill Teach?",
    "I've left my diving lot in the bank.",
    "Thanks, Cap'n!",
    "Nothing, I'll be on my way now.",
    "Looks like this brewer didn't make it. I'll see if I can find his name badge.",
    "That's all three of the missing brewers. I should bring the news to Cap'n Braindeath. If only it were happier news...",
    "I found the three missing brewers...",
    "Rory, Jimmy and Trent - all dead. I'm sorry...",
    "Well, the place was full of zombie surgeons injecting 'rum' into the wildlife. The crabs down there are giant and very, very aggressive now.",
    "Yes, I'm ready.",
    "I, Player, swear to thee...",
    "...what happens at sea, stays at sea.",
    "None shall learn of 'The Oath' from me...",

    "Um\u2026 cap\u2019n\u2026. I\u2026 I lost the Twiblick Night Special.",
    "How could I ever forget it?",
    "I have it! Whatever it is...",
    "Yes.",
    "I did. It was a particularly brutal oath that I don't intend to break.",
    "The moment of truth has arrived.",
    "What in the world?",
    "I...guess I need to talk to Bill Teach about the plan now, but I'm not sure I want to...",
    "So, uh, I opened the Twiblik Night Special...",
    "I'm a little hesitant to ask, but... Why do you have a secret box full of women's apparel?",
    "With an anchor! No, no, I didn't forget! How are we going to use this to get information?",
    "Come again?",
    "With pleasure.",
    "You're going to be so pretty when we're done, you'll turn heads!",
    "Tell us what we want to know or you'll get more pampering, you pretty little thing, you!",
    "Wait, what?",
    "Um...Bill?",
    "Do we know where we're sailing to now?",
    "Then let's hit the waves!",
    "Yes, let's get underway.",
    "What? But the zombie head! He told me himself he's involved!",
    "So, if I get conclusive evidence of his involvement in all this, will you finally actually do something about it?",
    "Argh! What's happening?",
    "Where did that attack come from, Bill?",
    "How are we ever going to get to the island now? We'll be sunk for sure if we try sailing in.",
    "I knew you'd think of something, cap'n! What is it? Oh, I can't wait to hear this!",
    "I'm...I'm not going to like this, am I?",
    "Yes, that's true enough.",
    "Go on...",
    "And then?",
    "...",
    "You want me to make a cannonball barrel-boat, sit on the barrel, and then fire it across the sea to the island using a cannon.",
    "Are you quite mad?",
    "But won't that really, really hurt?",
    "Awesome! I'll get right on it!",
    "Thanks! Wait... Aw.",
    "Here's an idea: YOU do it!",
    "Um, yes?",
    "Um, yours, cap'n?",
    "No, cap'n.",
    "Me, cap'n...",
    "Can you remind me how I\u2019m supposed to be doing this?",
    "And then?",
    "At least there\u2019s method to this madness\u2026",
    "Sweet.",
    "I have prepared the cannonball barrel-boat for travel to the island.",
    "What should I do when I land on the island?",
    "Swimming back?",
    "Oh, yeah... Are you even sure this will work?",
    "It's what makes it so terrifying for me... This is going to be fun!",
    "Well, here goes...",
    "AAAAAAAAAAH!",
    "Oof!",
    "What's this?",
    "Uh... Do I know you?",
    "It's still escaping me, I'm afraid.",
    "What?",
    "No! It can't be! The seagull from The Rock that I fired at Young Ralph's head!",
    "So... What are you doing here?",
    "Uh... Yes! I'm so deeply sorry!",
    "No, it was just my ride in.",
    "So, what's the nature of this proposal you mentioned?",
    "What do you mean?",
    "But how can we beat them?",
    "I'm ready to begin.",
    "I've been thinking the same. I'd be flinching and avoiding imaginary cannonballs every time I head a 'squark' otherwise.",
    "I was just about to, actually. Before you suggested it!",
    "The guns are disabled, cap'n. It's safe to approach the island.",
    "Well, the 'guns' turned out to be barrelchests patrolling the beach with their cannon-arms.I couldn't get close or I'd have been splatted by their anchors, so I telepathically communed with a seagull, the nefarious Baron von Hattenkrapper, and controlled him to drop cannonballs on them.",
    "Can you take me to Bloodsplatter Isle?",
    "Argh... Sleepy...",
    "Cap'n...I've a problem.",
    "What? No, I mean there's a problem with the investigation. The complex is heavily guarded by zombie surgeons using precision-thrown sedatives - I can't get inside.",
    "There's a storage area just inside the complex I can access. It had a bunch of medical supplies, and what looked like a dismantled barrelchest on a shelf.",
    "Aye, cap'n!",
    "I've gathered the things you asked for.",
    "Aye, cap'n!",
    "Wait...what's that on top?",
    "...",
    "Well, I guess it's time I take her out for a spin.",
    "I've performed some heavy sabotage on the facility and accrued a lot of evidence pointing to the involvement of Rabid Jack, and backing up the story about the attack on Mos'Le Harmless.",
    "Alright, cap'n. Time to finish in their house what they started in mine...",
    "Aye, cap'n!",
    "If I turn this machine on the conveyor belts will start, and I should be able to send explosive kegs along them into the machinery. Any nearby guards will hear me...",
    "Hold it right there, evildoers!",
    "Come back here!",
    "I need to catch them somehow!",
    "Hmmmm!",
    "Phew. I think I stopped them all. Time I sailed back to The Adventurous to talk to Bill.",
    "Weigh anchor! TOOT TOOT!",
    "Thanks, cap'n.",
    "Well, it has, cap'n, and we need to do something about it. What should we do next?",
    "What became of our pretty little friend?",
    "What do you need me to do, cap'n?"

    "Aye, Player. A Twiblik Night Special. I cannae tell ye of its unspeakable contents or the horrific things it has inflicted upon the world until ye prove to me an' Braindeath ye can be trusted to keep it a secret, but he'll entrust you with its transport te me as long as it's securely locked. Bring it back here te me when ye've got it.",

    "Aye? What is it, Player?",

    "Right ye are, Player.",

    "Ye have it?",
    "Hand it here, Player. Ye swore 'The Oath', didn't ye, Player?",

    "And then we be goin' te parade ye around in front of yer old crew...",
    "Well, lad? Would ye do the honours o' choosin' how we beautify our friend here?",
    "Right then, Player. Time to choose how we make our guest here pretty.",
    "First off, choose a wig! Shall we give her a bob, a bun, a fringe or pigtails?",
    "Now on to some colour for those cheeks, but what colour shall we pick, Player?",
    "We need to bring out those eyes, but which eyeshadow would go best on our friend here?",
    "Now we need to make those lips kissable! Well, lad?",
    "Well, I think that's everything, lad. What say we get started?",
    "Aye, some stomachs too.",
    "Right, lad. Time te ask our lady friend here where she comes from, savvy?",
    "Don't interrupt him, lad! So, we sail south of here for 50 nautical miles, then what?",
    "Not the lair o' the many-tentacled beast of unpleasant encounters?",
    "Hang on a second, that'd put the factory on Bloodsplatter Isle.",
    "Bloodsplatter Isle be cardinal south from here! Why didn't ye just say so?",
    "Ye be dangerously close te another makeover, petal. I'd watch meself if I were ye.",

    "Right ye are, Player.",

    "Aye, so ye say, but he never mentioned that same te me. Don't fret though, Player. We're on our way to investigate and shut down the facility now. If You-Know-Who is really involved, ye'll find the evidence needed to prove it while ye're there, no doubt.",
    "Aye, lad. If ye get me somethin' that backs up what our makeover mannequin said about this bein' a planned attack on Mos Le'Harmless, action will be taken, ye can rest assured o' that.",
    "We be approachin' visual distance to the island, Player. Ye'll have yer answers soo-",
    "INCOMING!",
    "We be under fire, lad! Hang on te somethin'!",
    "Phew. That were a close call, Player. We're lucky te not be sittin' pretty at the bottom of the sea right now.",
    "Seems our guide forget[sic] te mention the welcoming party. We were fired on from the island itself.",
    "Ye really are tryin' my patience, devil. I suggest ye realise the gravity of yer predicament. I'd hate te have te pierce yer ears.",
    "Nice big gold hoops. They'd look just darlin' on a gal like ye.",
    "Aye, that we will. I have a plan though, Player.",
    "Now, afore I go about tellin' ye, ye has te promise te hear it out, all the way to the end, before ye start objectin' and complainin'.",
    "Depends on how healthy yer sense of adventure is, lad. Now, here's the plan... We can't very well sail on in te dock. As ye've rightly pointed out, because we'd be riddled with holes and sunk before we made it halfway there.",
    "We also have limited resources on this ship. All we have te hand is cannons and cannonballs, gunpowder, some crates and barrels and some chains. Now, I've a plan involving these objects that ends up with ye on the island.",
    "What ye'll need te do is use some o' the gunpowder to flash-heat a chain and smith it to a cannonball. There be a hammer an' anvil in the hold along wi' plenty of powder, cannonballs and chains. Then ye need te attach the other end of the chain te one of the empty barrels.",
    "And then, ye sit on the barrel an' ye put the cannonball in the cannon wi' a double dose o' powder...then fire yerself te the island on it.",
    "Well, lad?",
    "Aye, that's about the size of it, lad.",
    "Nay, lad, I'm COMPLETELY mad. Bein' at sea with ye has done that to me. But regardless o' me mental state, this needs to be done. There be no other way.",
    "What're ye askin' me for? Ye think I've done anythin' like this ever before? Ye'll be a pioneer, lad. And anyhoo, there's no other way to the island, so it's got te happen.",
    "That's what I like about ye, lad. Ye're always enthusiastic, and ye're daft as a box o' frogs.",
    "Nice ship ye're on, isn't it, Player?",
    "Remind me again whose ship it is?",
    "Do ye want te swim home?",
    "So then, who's makin' the cannonball barrel-boat and bein' shot to the island?",
    "I'm glad that's settled.",
    "What ye'll need te do is use some o' the gunpowder to flash-heat a chain and smith it to a cannonball. There be a hammer an' anvil in the hold along wi' plenty of powder, cannonballs and chains. Then ye need te attach the other end of the chain te one of the empty barrels.",
    "Then come up here and load the cannonball into the cannon, and you\u2019re ready fer yer little trip.",
    "Well, lad, all ye need te do now is load two doese o' gunpowder, grab the barrel, fire the cannon and hold on fer dear life.",
    "Well, assumin' ye're still ali-, er, awake, if ye can knock out the guns on the beach that be firin' at us, that'd be a good start. Means I'd be safe te drop ye off and pick ye up with the ship from now on instead o' this cannon malarkey or ye swimmin' back.",
    "Well, I cannae exactly sail in an' pick ye up. We're goin' through all this effort te avoid me ship gettin' riddled wi' holes, in case ye didn't remember. If ye need te get back te the ship before the guns are disabled, ye'll be swimmin', lad.",
    "No, but that's what makes it so excitin' fer me!",
    "Aye, it almost certainly will be, lad. Fer me, at least.",
    "Ye're back, lad. How are ye gettin' along disablin' those guns?",
    "That's good te hear, Player. How did ye go about it in the end?",
    "... Just fer once, couldn't it have been somethin' normal? Like smashin' 'em with a big hammer? Ah, well. It's good news nonetheless. Want me te drop ye off, lad? Ye can start yer investigatin' now.",
    "Aye, Player. I'll drop ye off. Signal me from the dock if ye want picking up.",
    "Well done fer finally admittin' it, lad. That's half the battle.",
    "That certainly is a problem, lad. Couldn't ye get in at all?",
    "That gives me an idea, lad. Ye could walk freely around the complex if ye looked like one o' them, I'd wager. Ye're goin' te need parts for yer disguise. Go and grab a roll of bandage, a surgical mask and a bundle of parts from the storeroom, then grab a barrel from me hold. Once ye've got all that, come see me, and we'll build ye a disguise!",
    "Good work, lad. Let's knuckle down and build ye a disguise then, shall we?",
    "Right, take that there thingummy and jam it on that hoozit... And now fer the finishing touch...there! We're done, Player.",
    "That be our pretty little friend, lad! Finishes the disguise nicely, don't ye agree? And she'll keep her mouth shut too - I stuffed it wi' bandage and stuck that mask on te make sure o'that.",

    "Let's see it then, lad.",
    "This is grave news indeed, lad. Ye need te go an' finish the job afore it's too late. Ye shouldn't need te wear that barrelchest disguise inside any more, Player. Ye've wiped out all the guards now. I'll keep it wi' me in case we need it in future.",
    "Here, Player. Take these, and level that production line!",
    "I saw the battle from here, Player. Good sailing.",
    "Come on, lad. We cannae do any more damage around here. Let's sail back te Mos Le'Harmless an' meet in Joe's basement. Joe's is in northern Mos Le'Harmless.",
    "Well, lad, ye did it. Ye stopped the attack on Mos Le'Harmless, an' ye've proved te me that You-Know-Who is back. I had hoped this day would never come...",
    "It be time te prepare now, Player - te prepare fer war! I need time to make the necessary arrangements and gather the captains together. Without Gentleman Mallard, the council will be needin' a new head. I guess it's up te me, since it's only me ye've shown that You-Know-Who has returned. Thanks fer that, lad. Guess I should get started.",
    "I've kept her in custody, Player, along wi' yer disguise. We may just need it again one day.",

    "Well, it's not a happy tale, Player. Some of me brewers have gone missing.",
    "Well, they went te investigate an odd doorway-lookin' thing that was uncovered in a minor earthquake to the north of the island. No one else could fathom it, but these three were fresh recruits that just sailed in from Daemonheim, and they said they could figure it out, so I sent them through.",
    "That were three days ago, lad.",
    "Aye, Player. That I will. Although I'm not expecting a rescue at this point. If ye find them, bring me proof of their fate. That'll suffice. While ye're searchin', I'll see about preparin' the Twiblik Night Special for ye.*",
    "One more thing, lad. There be water leakin' out of the doorway-lookin' thing. There's a fairly good chance that whatever's on the other side is flooded. Ye'll need te take somethin' that'll let ye breathe underwater.",
    "Well, ye can take mine, an' I'll take yours from the bank next time I'm there.",
    "Anythin' else, lad?",

    "So that's what the swine was doin' with me 'rum'! Well, he'll get nay more from me, of that ye can rest easy! Anyway, lad. Back te business. I've the Twiblik Night Special for ye right here, but even ye aren't getting it without swearing 'The Oath'. Do ye think yerself ready, Player? 'The Oath' ye be about to swear carries with it untold weight. The secret ye will be entrusted with must be carried te yer grave.",

That's the only reason I haven't already unleashed havoc and devastation upon you, Player. I want to know why you would inflict such a thing upon yourself. Is this your way to atone?)",
