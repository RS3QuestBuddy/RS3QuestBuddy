    "Player, well met! I have news! The dwarves have cleared the rock-slide in the Corridor of Light. Now we can sneak inside and see what Lord Iorwerth has done to my beloved city.",
    "The Iorwerth clan of elves control what's left of Prifddinas, the elf city. The other seven clans are exiled in the forest. The 'Mourners' in control of West Ardougne are actually Iorwerth-clan elves. They've been using human slave labour to dig for the Temple of Light, which Lord Iorwerth thinks he can use to summon the Dark Lord. You infiltrated the ranks of the Mourners, got into the Temple of Light, and re-activated its defences. That stopped Lord Iorwerth's plan - but the Mourners are still in West Ardougne, and they may have a new plan. You also discovered an ancient corridor between the Temple of Light and the Prifddinas Undercity, but it was blocked with rubble. Now, my dwarven allies have cleared the rubble, so we have a secret route straight into the heart of Iorwerth-controlled Prifddinas. I want us to sneak into the Prifddinas Undercity using the corridor, find out what Lord Iorwerth is planning, and stop him for good. If you want more information, you should speak to Gwir in the next room. She's been making a record of events so far, and I'm sure she'd appreciate your help.",
    "I'll be here when you're ready.",
    "The Prifddinas Undercity will be swarming with Iorwerth soldiers. We'll need to disguise ourselves as Deathguards - or Mourners, as you call them in Ardougne. I still have the Mourner disguise you fetched for me before we visited the Temple of Light, so we just need a set for you.",
    "Mourners regularly walk across the Arandar Pass, to the north of here. Killing one and taking their clothes should be no problem for a hero like you. You'll need six pieces: top, trousers, cloak, gloves, boots, and gas mask. I already have my set, so you just need one for yourself.",
    "I can teleport us straight to the Corridor of Light. Are you ready?",
    "The door to the west leads to the Prifddinas Undercity. Soon we'll see what's become of the Undercity since the Iorwerth drove the other clans out.",
    "You should wear your Mourner disguise. We need to be able to pass for Iorwerth-clan elves.",
    "You should wear your Mourner disguise. We need to be able to pass for Iorwerth-clan elves.",
    "Remember, we're members of the Iorwerth Deathguard - Mourners, you call them. We need to get into the Undercity without breaking cover.",
    "That's blown it! Let's get out of here!",
    "The captain told us to relieve the guards watching the archaeologist. That should give us a chance to see what he's doing.",
    "Those stairs lead to the surface, but we're not done down here yet. Iestin Edern is here in the undercity.",
    "That door leads to the Grand Library of Prifddinas! Lord Iorwerth's plan must have something to do with it. You should speak to Iestin Edern - maybe we'll learn something.",
    "You should do that. I'll stay here and watch Iestin Edern. While you're up there, maybe you can find some information about Lord Iorwerth's plan.",
    "I'll wait here while you take that report to the mayor, up those stairs. While you're up there, see if you can find out what Lord Iorwerth is planning.",
    "Yes, so do I...",
    "Yes, so do I...",
    "I think I know what to do. Player, it's time for you to go back to Ardougne. The humans of West Ardougne are oppressed, but they're not completely broken. With the right prompting, they could overthrow the Deathguard.",
    "I think we can trust you, Iestin. I'll explain everything once Player is on [his/her] way. Player, take the Iorwerth master plan to Bravek the Warder of West Ardougne, and Councillor Halgrive in East Ardougne. Explain it to them like Iestin Edern explained it to us. It's time to start a revolution.",
    "Player, take the Iorwerth master plan to Bravek the Warder of West Ardougne, and Councillor Halgrive in East Ardougne. Explain it to them like Iestin Edern explained it to us. It's time to start a revolution.",
    "You did it, Player! The Mourners are in full-scale retreat from West Ardougne!",
    "There's only one way to stop him, and that's to re-grow the city before he does.",
    "Lord Iorwerth's Prifddinas would be dominated by the Iorwerth clan. Elves of other clans would be second-class citizens at best, and he could use the city as a base from which to conquer the human lands. If we were to re-grow the city first, using the power of the eight clans rather than the power of the Dark Lord, the city would be under our control. We could make it into its old self - a city shared between the eight clans.",
    "Even the legends are vague. The Dark Lord is the ultimate evil, a bogeyman to scare children with.",
    "This speculation is wasting time. Whatever the Dark Lord is, it's Lord Iorwerth's ally, which means it's our enemy. That's all we need to know.",
    "I am. I vowed not to use my title until I had led my clan out of exile and back into Prifddinas. With your help, that day is close at hand.",
    "You should go back to Lletya. Gwir the scribe will be able to help you find the six remaining elders. You should speak to her next. I can teleport you between here and Lletya. Are you ready to go now?",
    "You need to find all six clan leaders so we can re-grow Prifddinas, before Lord Iorwerth finds another way to call on the Dark Lord. You should speak to Gwir in Lletya.",
    "I can teleport us back to the Undercity as soon as you're ready.",
    "You did it, Player! I never thought I'd see all the elders together again.",
    "Unless they're already occupied! The remnant of King Tyras's army is still facing off against Lord Iorwerth's war-camp. The two forces are too evenly matched for either one to risk an attack. If you were to convince General Hining in the Tyras camp to attack now, it would keep Lord Iorwerth and his forces occupied while we re-grow the city and defeat Lord Iorwerth for good!",
    "Go to the Tyras Camp and convince General Hining to attack Lord Iorwerth now. That will keep Lord Iorwerth occupied so we can re-grow the city.",
    "It's time, Player!",
    "...And then Lord Iorwerth will return to find a city that we control! Come on, Player! Enter the Grand Library and let's finish this!",
    "This is it! The Grand Library!",
    "All you need to do now is direct the light from each clan seal into the Seal of Seren. Start with the Cadarn seal. You should interact with the plinths in order to create mirrors on them to re-direct the beam. When you're ready, activate the Cadarn seal and I'll sing into it to create the beam.",
    "I'm ready, Player! Activate the seal and I'll sing to create the light beam.",
    "What's happening? What are those creatures?",
    "This doesn't change what you have to do, Player. Direct the beam from the Trahaearn seal into the Seal of Seren.",
    "What is that?",
    "It looks like you'll need to defeat that Greater Shadow before you can direct the light beam from the Iorwerth seal to the Seal of Seren.",
    "You did it, Player! The Dark Lord is dead!",
    "This room will be the foundation of a new Prifddinas: but this time, it'll be different... For all of its history, Prifddinas has been closed to outsiders. Elves regarded other races as inferior barbarians. Even when we were exiled from the city, the rebel elves didn't think about the humans beyond the mountains. We heard what the Deathguard was doing in West Ardougne, but we only cared about our own city. But when you emerged from the Underground Pass, we saw that a human adventurer could be more resourceful than the greatest of elves. If you hadn't helped us, the Dark Lord would have created an evil Prifddinas and doomed the elves to live under Lord Iorwerth's rule. I've talked to the other clan leaders and we're unanimous: Prifddinas will no longer be a city only for elves. Once it's re-grown, we'll throw the doors open to other races. This is the end of an epic adventure for you, and the start of a new age for both elves and humans. I'll see you in Prifddinas soon, Player.",
    "I've got fifteen items to give you as a reward. Would you like me to take some items to your bank for you so you can free up space?",
    "You did it, Player! The process of re-growing the city has started. Soon the crater will be filled with the new city of Prifddinas, and humans will be able to visit.",
    "You are just in time, my friend. Come, see the fruits of your labours.",
    "Welcome to Prifddinas, lost city of the elves."

    "You! What were you doing in the store room? Honestly, I think every batch of new recruits the mayor sends me is stupider than the last. I'm up to my ear-points in paperwork and I do not have time to babysit you. Don't. Wander. Off. So? Don't just stand there gawping. What were you doing in the store room?",
    "Yes, the store room. We told you when you joined the Deathguard that the door to the Temple of Light is blocked, so that room is a dead end. What were you doing in there?",
    "There must be a fault with your mask, soldier. Your voice is so muffled that it sounded like you were talking back to me! Take your mask off and say that again!",
    "Of course there are going to be mice. Why does that justify leaving your post without permission?",
    "SORRY? You're a soldier in the Iorwerth Deathguard. You're trained to stand proud, not grovel like a... Like a... Take off your mask! Prove to me that you're an elf!",
    "That's the first sensible thing you've said. I'll let you off this time, but don't go wandering into the store room again. Maybe some time watching that tedious archaeologist will teach you your lesson. You two can relieve the guards in the next room. Once you've relieved the guards, tell Iestin Edern to hurry! Lord Iorwerth's plan is waiting for him."

    "Really? Well, if you say so. I'll sleep easier tonight knowing these people got something to eat.",
    "A human? Well I don't know how you got in here, but you might as well go out the same way. There's nothing of value here.",
    "You should return to the mayor and tell her we'll distribute the food, as ordered.",

  "Iestin Edern": [
    "More new guards? If you have to be here, please keep quiet - I can't concentrate with guards peering over my shoulder.",
    "Weren't you told anything? I thought Deathguards at least knew the basics. Through that door is the Grand Library. The city of Prifddinas - the real one, not the temporary camp up those stairs - is stored in the Grand Library in the form of a giant crystal seed. Lord Iorwerth asked me to find a way to re-grow the city without the other seven leaders. He says he'll provide a source of magical power, and he wants me to prepare the crystal to receive that power.",
    "I gather it's something to do with what the Deathguard are doing in the human city of Ardougne. I've heard the phrase 'Dark Lord' in connection with it, but I don't know what that means.",
    "They're still there - encoded in the crystal! When the city is re-grown, they'll wake up as if nothing happened. I don't know what Lord Iorwerth plans to do about the non-Iorwerth elves. I imagine they'll be given a chance to join the Iorwerth clan.",
    "I'd be able to work faster if I knew what Lord Iorwerth's plan was. How can I work if I don't know how my work will fit into the overall plan? I'm sorry. I know it's not your fault. You probably know less than I do. Look, if you want to speed things up a little, could one of you take my latest report to the mayor of Prifddinas?",
    "The stairs in this room lead to Prifddinas.",
    "You should take the report to the mayor of Prifddinas. You should go up the stairs in this room and find the mayor in her office.",
    "Please keep out of the Grand Library. My work involves some delicate magic and I don't want it to be disrupted.",
    "I wish I knew what Lord Iorwerth's plan was.",
    "I wish I knew what Lord Iorwerth's plan was.",
    "The Iorwerth master plan! How did you convince the mayor to... No, don't answer that. Let me read it first.",
    "Let's see... 'large-scale conversion of quasi-elf resources into necromantic power'. That means... Lord Iorwerth is planning to murder the whole population of West Ardougne! He was right to keep it from me. If I'd known what he was planning, I wouldn't have helped. Humans are lesser creatures but that doesn't mean they have no rights at all.",
    "It's in the plan: 'large-scale conversion of quasi-elf resources into necromantic power'. 'Quasi-elf' is our technical term for humans. They look mostly like elves, but they aren't. 'Quasi-elf resources' are the humans that the Deathguard are controlling in West Ardougne. Converting them into necromantic power - that means killing them all in a magical ritual.",
    "Lord Iorwerth wants to summon the 'Dark Lord' in order to use its power to re-grow Prifddinas. I don't know what the Dark Lord is, but I gather it's associated with death, and with the Temple of Light. Lord Iorwerth's initial plan was to summon the Dark Lord using the Temple of Light, but he had to abandon that plan when the temple's defences started working again. It looks like he's now abandoned the Temple of Light plan and is going to summon the Dark Lord using its association with death - by killing a large number of humans.",
    "I don't know. I can stall him for a while, but sooner or later he'll replace me with someone more compliant.",
    "Wait...who are you two? You're not Deathguards...",
    "Yes, you've stopped Lord Iorwerth for now...but sooner or later he'll find another way to call on the Dark Lord's power.",
    "Whoever grows the city, controls the city.",
    "All I know is that it's a source of great magical power, and it's associated with death, and with the Temple of Light. Everything else I've heard is an unsubstantiated legend.",
    "When humans first heard about the Dark Lord, they assumed it was an elven way of talking about Zamorak - the ultimate evil of their mythology - but there's no evidence that they're the same being.",
    "We need you to find the leaders of the eight elven clans. Obviously we can't expect Lord Iorwerth to help with this, but I know enough about the magic required to take his place. We also already have Lord Cadarn. That leaves six to find.",
    "It's a historic occasion, but let's not celebrate yet. There's another thing you'll need to do before we re-grow the city. For now my magic is able to keep us hidden from the Deathguard. Anyone who looks into this room will just see me at my desk... Once we start to re-grow the city, though, I won't be able to hide us any more. Lord Iorwerth's army will rush in and overwhelm us. Unless...",
    "Lord Iorwerth has called the Deathguard away to fight General Hining. We should be able to re-grow the city undisturbed.",
    "A library is a store of information, not necessarily a store of books. This library stores the most precious information there is - the city of Prifddinas and its inhabitants, encoded as patterns in the crystal. When we have powered the crystal with the light of the eight clans, the city will grow according to that pattern.",
    "They're shadow creatures, like the ones in the Temple of Light - but these ones aren't bothering to hide flat on the ground. It looks like some force is opposing us.",
    "I fear so! You prevented Lord Iorwerth from summoning it fully - but it seems it still has enough power to oppose us!",
    "My guess is that the shadows infesting the Temple of Light were the least powerful of the Dark Lord's minions, and that's one of the more powerful ones.",
    "You're doing well, Player. Activate the Iorwerth seal when you're ready.",
    "You've empowered the Seal of Seren. The clan leaders can sing the city into shape as it grows.",
    "Lord Iorwerth's reign is over at last! Now my clan can take its proper place as one of eight equal parts of the new city.",
    "It's too dangerous to enter while the city is re-growing. You should come back later.",

  "Mayor of Prifddinas": [
    "Good day, soldier! Have you got something for me? Whatever it is, it can't be more boring than this latest draft of Lord Iorwerth's master plan. You should be grateful it's above your clearance level so you don't have to read it.",
    "Oh, yes. I know there's a rumour that his plan failed when the Temple of Light's defences came back on, but it was only a minor setback. The details of his new plan are right here on my desk. I'm the only civilian who's allowed to read it. It's being kept strictly secret - if it were to fall into our enemies' hands, it could be disastrous!",
    "Another one? Let me guess - he's complaining about not being able to see the master plan. He should count himself lucky he doesn't have to read Lord Iorwerth's tedious writing! Anyway, he's too much of a risk. These intellectuals are always putting their own crazy ideas over loyalty to the clan. If he saw the master plan, he might refuse to help, and then where would we be? This report should keep me busy until my lunch arrives. I'm expecting a shipment of gnomish foods from Arposandra. I simply can't subsist on the same muck the common people have to eat, you know? If you want to be useful, you could go and check up on it for me. I don't want to have to go and check on it myself.",
    "Human! I don't know how you got into Prifiddinas, but you won't get any further! You'll never defeat the Iorwerth!",
    "Naughty Deathguard! You know you're not allowed to touch that.",
    "Human! I don't know how you got into Prifiddinas, but you won't get any further! You'll never defeat the Iorwerth!",
    "I hope my gnomish food arrives soon. I don't want to have to go and check on it myself.",
    "What? This is unacceptable! That food is mine! The common elves have no right to touch it. Stay here and guard the master plan on my desk. I'm going to go and deal with this outrage.",

And now they're going to round everyone up and murder them as soon as their magic crystal thing is ready. Gods. I suspected there was more to the plague than the official story, but this is worse than I could have imagined.",
    "A plague with no symptoms, besides what you'd expect from people starving in a slum? Doctors who never show their faces? People who vanish, and we only have the doctors' word they died of plague? I'm sure it all looks convincing from outside the wall, but in here...of course I'd suspected.",
    "What could I do? People who ask questions always seem to be next to die of plague. It's best not to even think about it. Once you've had a few drinks you can believe that the plague is real and the Mourners are here to make us all better.",
    "I'm not the person you need to help you. If I had the strength of character to stand up to the Mourners then King Lathas wouldn't have let me stay in this position. Not to mention that people will probably see me as a collaborator. As far as the population is concerned, I might as well be wearing a plague mask. But...let me give you a list of names. I'm not the sort to start a revolution, but if I were...these are the people I'd get on my side first.",
    "Good luck, adventurer. I'm glad someone's got the guts to do what you're doing.",
    "Thanks for all your help, adventurer.",
    "It's so much easier to administrate a city when there's no fake plague and people are allowed in and out. And do you know what? I'm off the drink. I'm going to be sober from now on. No more hangovers, no more strange hangover cures!"

My father, King Ulthas, ruled all of Kandarin - including Camelot, and both halves of the city of Ardougne. I am his eldest son - all of Kandarin should have been my birthright. Then another so-called king, Arthur, arrived out of nowhere, with his knights and their round table. He claimed to be from another world but I don't believe that. My father kicked the Sinclairs - good, loyal subjects - out of their castle, and gave it to this new king. Not only that - he then declared that the kingdom should be split between me and my idiot younger brother, Tyras. I could not stand by and let the kingdom be fragmented. When I ascended to my half-throne, I made it my mission to unify my father's kingdom under my rule. Lord Iorwerth promised to help me with that.",

She passed away shortly after finishing work on Lletya.",

There are some legends of holy people walking on water, but I don't know if Lady Hefin was quite that holy. It might not have been just any water, though. 'The water' is an old name for the marsh to the south-west of Lletya, from before it became known as the Poison Waste.",

    "The riddle was literally true - Lady Ithell put her soul into her greatest work. She took part of her soul - the essential truths about who she was, and what made her Lady Ithell - and encoded them in the statue plans you found around Lletya. I'm a member of Clan Ithell, with a love of architecture. When I saw the statue, that soul spoke to me...I mean, spoke in the same way a work of art speaks to someone who looks at it. I gained the essential knowledge of the leader of Clan Ithell. I am the new Lady Ithell - I could sing her part of the city into shape!",

I spent long years meditating, until at last I understood the Spirit Plane more deeply - took its power into myself - became a creature of the Spirit Plane. I belong there as much as here. When Lord Iorwerth hunted for the elders, it was a simple ritual to send me to my adopted home, safe from both his search and the ravages of time!",

What does a crystal's hardness represent?",

    "There's more to most places than meets the eye. The right potion can help you see things that you'd normally miss. I brewed the right potion, and I found a dungeon room that I felt sure could never be found without it.",
    "Did you know an entirely different set of herbs grow in the dungeon than grow in the outside world? Some elven explorers discovered the entrance back in the days of Baxtorian's empire. The Meilyr clan mounted expeditions to bring back some of the exotic herbs. When Lord Iorwerth began hunting the clan leaders and I needed a hiding place, the dungeon of exotic herbs seemed ideal.",

If we were to attack, we might gain ground temporarily but Lord Iorwerth could bring in reinforcements to drive us back.",

I found solace beneath the mountains, in the Death Altar - and then I was trapped by the Temple of Light.
