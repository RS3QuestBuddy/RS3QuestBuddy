Talk to the ogre guard (without the combat level, east).`
Climb over the crushed barricade.`
Run east and down the stairs.`
Run as far north-west as you can, and search the skeleton, kill the zombie, and take his backpack.`
If you're in combat when trying to search the skeleton, the zombie will not spawn.`
Open the backpack. You will get a dragon inn tankard, knife, and rotten food. Drop all except the dragon inn tankard.`
Search the broken lectern behind the skeleton.`
Read the Torn page`
Search the nearby Ogre coffin until you find a Black prism (may take multiple attempts).`
Enter the Dragon Inn pub in Yanille.`
Use the dragon inn tankard on the bartender.`

Search the drawers, the cupboard, and the wardrobe.`
Read the 3 books, use the papyrus on Sithik to make a portrait, then use the portrait on Sithik.`
Make sure that Sithik says that he appreciates "honesty" of the portrait or you will have to make another. If he says 'truth' you will have to try again. There is more papyrus in the drawers.`
Use the portrait on the bartender. He will return it as a Signed portrait.`
If he just says that he recognises Sithik without signing the portrait, it means that you forgot to show him the dragon inn tankard.`
Show your items that you have gathered to Zavistic (including the H.A.M and necromancy books) in the magic guild (show the portrait last). He will give you a strange potion. (Chat 1•3)`
Use the strange potion on the cup of tea beside Sithik.`
Climb down the ladder, climb up the ladder, ask Sithik all the possible questions. (Chat 1•2•3•4)`
It is highly recommended that lower levelled players bring ranged equipment at this point. They should also buy or make a comp ogre bow and some brutal arrows during this part of the quest, as Slash Bash will take 75% reduced damage from all other sources and despawns after 5 minutes if not killed.`
Return to Grish at the quest start, he will give you a key. (Chat 1)`
Talk to him again to be able to create a comp ogre bow and brutal arrows, which can be used to fight the upcoming boss. (Chat 2)`
(Optional) Use a clean rogue's purse on a vial of water, and then add a clean snakeweed to create a relicym's balm. Use this on Uglug Nar next to Grish, and you unlock his shop Uglug's Stuffsies which sells the comp ogre bow.`
(Optional) Either buy brutal arrows from the Grand Exchange, or fletch them at this point; there are achey trees to the west of Grish, chop them down and fletch their logs into shafts, then attach feathers, and tip them with nails of your choosing.`
Cross the barricade to the east and go down the stairs again.`
Once inside, run directly west, through the double doors and down more stairs.`
Go north-east and search the stand in front of the pile of skulls. Prepare for battle.`
Kill Slash Bash, pick up the Ogre artefact he drops.`
