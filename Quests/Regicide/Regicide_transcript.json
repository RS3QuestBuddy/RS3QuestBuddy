    "Ahh.. Player. Yes... We have finally finished the work on the Well of Voyage. It is now time for us to move against my brother.",
    "I've managed to get a letter through to the elves that live to the west. They informed me that Tyras and his brigands are camped up in the woods to the South[sic] of their city. The elves have agreed to help, however they have their battles to fight. Unfortunately the men at arms I promised you are unavailable but I have faith that you'll get the job done. Finally and most importantly you must find an easy way to the west lands. We cannot use the well as a trade route, and certainly cannot move any bulk of troops through there. In short you must use the underpass to enter the west lands, kill my brother Tyras, find an easy route home and finally return back here, to report. And don't worry, you will be well rewarded.",
    "Ah... Player how goes your exploration? Any luck finding my brother in the west lands?",
    "What are you doing here then? I'm counting on you Player.",
    "This is grand news indeed! You'll forgive me if I'm a little apprehensive about this, but I take it you do have proof?",
    "I am sure you have done as you say, but on this matter I can afford no doubts. You must find something to confirm your story.",
    "Yes... Good... This will do nicely. Well done, You're really proving to be quite useful. I'll send word when I next require your services. Oh and I guess you'll be wanting your reward.",

  "Lord Iorwerth": [
    "Ahh, Player. Welcome to Isafdar. I understand you've been sent here to rid us of that criminal Tyras. I offer my full support. Unfortunately all my troops are hunting down a group of renegade elves, but you should find one of our trackers by Tyras's old camp. He should be able to help you.",
    "The only help I can offer at this time is the use of a tracker. He can be found over the river to the south east. Good luck!",
    "Good day, Player. How may I help you now?",
    "Bless his loyalty but curse his suspicion. Here, he will recognise this:",
    "Just show him the pendant I gave you.",

    "Player! How goes your search? Any luck hunting down that brigand?",
    "Good job. I had a plan to destroy his camp, using the knowledge found in this book but before I had perfected any formula they moved camp. Here, you may find the book useful.",
    "Good day, Player. Have you yet found a way to rid us of Tyras?",
    "Good, we are running short of time.",
    "It's lucky I had a scribe make a few copies.",
    "Good good... One of my scouts just reported that they have seen his tent in a ball of flame. I'm sure you will want to get back to your king and tell him. He will undoubtedly want some proof. Give him this letter; it verifies that the job is done. He should trust me enough in this matter.",
    "You may use the pass through Arandar to return home. You'll find the start of the trail in the far north-east of the woods. I have ordered the guards there to let you pass the Arandar palisade.",

    "And you have something to prove this?",
    "That's Lord Iorwerth's pendant. He must have a lot of faith in you. Now what is it I can help you with?",
    "Well this was his old camp. After the battle a few days ago they moved and now we're having trouble tracking him down.",
    "As it goes I'm not actually tracking them at the moment. This here is the best trace we've had on our renegade brethren.",
    "Ahh I guess you can't see with those human eyes. I tell you what. I'll continue to search here on the east side. You check out the west end of the camp. Come and tell me if you find anything.",
    "What is it I can help you with?",
    "These woods are a tangle of animal tracks and hidden paths. There's bound to be a way past. Look for things like flattened grass, broken twigs, disturbed leaf litter and such like. I'm sure now you know what you're looking for you will have no trouble following the tracks.",
    "How goes the hunt for that bandit camp?",
    "How goes the hunt for that bandit camp?",
    "I'm sure Lord Iorwerth will be pleased to hear that.",

    "Yes... yessss... Well, I guess you'll be wanting to use the old still.",
    "Well, you're going to need Naphtha, quicklime and brimstone.",
    "Well, to make naphtha you're going to need to distil tar of some kind. You can use my still outside, but it's not been used in a long time.",
    "It's quite simple really. You have to get the still heat up very high to make this fuel. But if it gets too hot it will burn out and you will have to start over. You must also watch the pressure, if it gets too high you will also have to start over. There are valves to control pressure and tar flow. These will also affect the heat of the still.",
    "You'll also need plenty of coal to keep the still hot.",
    "Quicklime is usually made by the thermal decomposition of limestone. When it gets really hot it glows like the sun. It's also extremely caustic.",
    "I've never seen it in the quantities this formula talks of but it's a yellow powdery formation. Much more than that I don't know."

I keep seeing rabbits in this forest. What I wouldn't give to eat one, but I'm not quick enough to kill any and I'm no good with a bow.",
    "You cooked me a rabbit! Thanks a lot. You don't mind watching things while I take 5 to eat it, do you?",

    "There is still a chance to stop this. But we must be careful, or they will push their plans forward and act before we're ready. Give the message to King Lathas, He will not see my little spell. Act like nothing unusual happened. You're going to be our man on the inside.",
    "How can I put this... This isn't a struggle for land or title. It is a war for life, all life. If the gate to Zamoraks[sic] world is opened we all die. Deliver your message, act normal. We'll be in touch."
