    "I seek a hero to go on an important mission!",
    "I require the Staff of Armadyl. It is in the deserted Temple of Ikov, near Hemenster, north east of here. Take care hero! There is a dangerous monster somewhere in the temple!",
    "The guardians of the Staff of Armadyl fear me! They have set up a magical barrier which even my power cannot overcome!",
    "It's not as easy as it sounds. The monster can only be killed with a weapon of ice. There are many other dangers.",
    "Take this pendant. Without it you will not be able to enter the Chamber of Fear.",
    "I cannot stay here much longer. I will be west of the Grand Exchange in Varrock. I have a small holding up there.",
    "Wimp! Call yourself a hero?! My daughter is more a hero than you!",
    "I see you are the mercenary type.",
    "I will reward you well if you bring me the staff.",
    "Hmph.",
    "Well, if you see any be sure to point them in my direction.",
    "I told you not to meet me here again!",
    "My patience grows thin hero! I need the Staff of Armadyl. It's in the Temple of Ikov, near Hemenster, north east of here.",
    "Have you got the Staff of Armadyl yet?",
    "You don't want to attack me. I am your friend.",
    "Gah! I don't have time for this. I'll find someone else to do my bidding.",
    "Have you got the Staff of Armadyl yet?",
    "Muhahahhahahaha! I can feel the power of the staff running through me! I will be more powerful and they shall bow down to me! I suppose you want your reward? I shall grant you much power!"

    "I am a mighty hero!",
    "Why can't you get it yourself?",
    "That sounds like a laugh!",
    "I'm up for it!",
    "Oh no! Sounds far too dangerous!",
    "What's the reward?!",
    "It's a living.",
    "I'll pass this time.",

    "Yes, I've got them.",
    "I seek the Staff of Armadyl.",
    "Lucien will give me a grand reward for it!",
    "How dare you call me a fool! I will work for whom I want!",
    "I just thought of something I must do!",
    "You're right, it's time for my yearly bath.",
    "Give it to me!",
    "I collect rare and powerful artefacts.",
    "Out of my way fool!",
    "Why not?!",
    "Then you must die!",

    "What are your kind and what are you doing here?",
    "What is the Armadyl?[sic]",
    "Ah ok, thanks.",
    "Someone told me there were only three gods. Saradomin, Zamorak and Guthix.",
    "Who are the Mahjarrat?",
    "Did you say Lucien? It was Lucien that asked me to get the staff!",
    "You're right, it's time for my yearly bath.",
    "I hope you are doing a good job then!",
    "Wow! You must be really old!",
    "Ok! I'll help!",
    "Yes!",

  "Guardian of Armadyl": [
    "Thou art a foul agent of Lucien! Such an agent must die!",
    "Thou hast ventured deep into the tunnels, you have reached the temple of our master. It is many ages since a pilgrim has come here.",
    "We are the guardians of the staff, our fathers were guardians and our father's fathers before that. Why dost thou seek it?",
    "Thou art working for that spawn of evil?! Fool. You must be cleansed to save your soul!",
    "We must cleanse the temple!",
    "An agent of evil cannot be allowed to leave!",

    "Go in peace.",
    "Saradominists. Bleh. They only acknowledge those three. There are at least twenty gods!",
    "They are ancient and powerful beings of evil! it is said that they once had great influence over this plane of existence, and that Zamorak was once of their kind. They are far fewer in number now, but there are still some present in this world. One such as Lucien would become nigh unstoppable if he were to possess the Staff of Armadyl",
    "You are a fool to be working for Lucien! Your soul must be cleansed to save you!",

    "No! I am not old! my family has guarded the staff for many generations.",
    "You have been cleansed!",
    "Lucien must not get hold of the staff! He would become too powerful!",
    "Hast thou come across this foul beast? If you know where he is you can help us defeat him.",
    "So he is close by?",
    "He must be after the staff. Here, take this pendant; wear it to show your allegiance to us, then defeat him in combat. I doubt you'll kill him, but it should discourage him for a while.",
    "Fool! You will die for your sins!",
    "Linger a while and be at peace.",
    "Have you rid us of Lucien yet?",
    "Hurry friend! Time is against us!"
