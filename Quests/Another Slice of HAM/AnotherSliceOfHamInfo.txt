If you need more inventory space you can talk to Tegdak per restored artefact, you don't need to give all in at once`
Use each of them on the specimen table.`

With the guards out of sight, enter the small room. As they walk north passing the room, exit the room (let them see you for a second), then quickly run south and hide behind a crate on the northern wall.`
Once the guards from north attack the goblins, lure the next guard towards the goblins by running past the goblins so that they will focus on the goblins instead.`
Repeat the step to lure the last guard with the same method.`
With the last guard engaging the goblins, it is safe to run south to the ladder.`
Equip the ancient mace and climb down the ladder.`
If you have legacy combat enabled, simply use the Ancient Mace's special attack at the start of the fight and finish him however you choose.`
Initiate combat with Sigmund. Once you reach 100% adrenaline, use its special attack to disable Sigmund's prayers. Be sure to not have any ranged or magic equipment on as your special attack will miss. The special attack ability can be found in the Constitution ability book. After disabling his prayers, other weapons may be used to kill him.`
After defeating Sigmund, untie Zanik.`
