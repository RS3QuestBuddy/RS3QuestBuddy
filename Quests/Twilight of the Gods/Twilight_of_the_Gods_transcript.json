    "Agh... it hurts. We were attacked by demons down in Senntisten. Please, can you help me?",
    "There may not be much time. Please, whatever you are busy with, get back here as soon as you are able.",
    "Thank you.",
    "I didn't see much, as it all happened so fast. I was cleaning up with my patrol inside the city, when we were ambushed by demons.",
    "I know a demon when I see one. Winged, red, grotesque. Demons, clear as day.",
    "Yeah, those're the ones.",
    "No. The only demons during the war were those three generals. These were new.",
    "Anyway, we were just packing up. It was so sudden. I blinked, and we were surrounded.",
    "Before I knew it, they started killing my comrades.",
    "In the middle of the slaughter something else hit us from the other side. It tore through my men without hesitation but then it went after the demons.",
    "I've never seen anything like it before. It went after those demons like nothing I've seen in my long years of service.",
    "I'm not quite sure how I managed to crawl out, but somehow I did. Thank Saradomin.",
    "Whatever that thing was, it was more dangerous than the demons. A lot more.",
    "Do you have any idea what it was? We can't just leave it to attack all of the patrols around Senntisten.",
    "It was humanoid, but large. Larger than a man, and gangly. And it moved so strangely, like a... a dancer?",
    "It was dark. Maybe brown or maybe... yellow-ish?",
    "Be careful, there could still be some demons lurking about.",
    "I'll make my way back to Falador when I can.",
    "I should be okay. Did you manage to find the creature?",
    "I should be okay. Did you manage to find the creature?"

  "Player": [
    "Here, keep the pressure applied on the larger wounds.",
    "Can you tell me what happened here?",
    "Demons? Are you sure?",
    "Those sound like avernic demons. Zamorakian.",
    "Left over from the war? Like you?",
    "What was it?",
    "That sounds... horrifying. I'm sorry you had to experience that.",
    "But go on.",
    "Can you give me a description?",
    "Interesting. What colour was it?",
    "That's useful to know, thanks. I'll have a look around the city to see if there's anything else that could help.",
    "How are you holding up?",
    "Not yet I'm afraid. I'll keep looking.",
    "They stood no chance.",
    "I should definitely not touch that.",
    "Perhaps from a fireball?",
    "Looks fresh. I should follow this, it might lead to whatever was behind this attack.",
    "Oh no - Naressa's house? I hope she's okay.",
    "Now is not the time for that.",
    "Can I get past?",
    "But I'll make sure to wear my spiked boots...",
    "Can I get past?",
    "But I'll make sure to wear my gas mask...",
    "Can I get past?",
    "You'll get used to it soon enough.",
    "What are you going to do with all the bodies?",
    "Maybe another time. I'm in the middle of an important quest right now.",
    "Gregorovic? What are you doing here?",
    "Er... Sorry, who is your guest?",
    "...Hello? Uh, Naressa, you're still here?",
    "And who is your uh... houseguest we have here?",
    "Naressa, he's dangerous. Back away slowly.",
    "His name is Gregorovic. He's a monster.",
    "Yes. He was Sliske's general at the Heart of Gielinor. We haven't seen him for a while.",
    "Look out!",
    "Mean what?",
    "What are you talking about?",
    "He doesn't seem to know that?",
    "That makes sense, I suppose.",
    "There's a slight possibility that Gregorovic - sorry, Erasinus - is a demon that thinks it's a person.",
    "In the Fourth Age, a dying human made a deal with a Mahjarrat called Sliske to save his own life.",
    "He was a nasty piece of work alive, but once he was reborn into this unsettling jester form he became a true monster.",
    "I think everyone just assumed he was a wight, since those were Sliske's thing.",
    "Now I'm not so sure.",
    "A while ago I met a demon, Senecianus, who seemed to be trapped in the form of a little girl.",
    "It turned out he'd eaten her and somehow assumed her identity.",
    "I think the same thing might have happened to Greg.",
    "Sliske must have fed you Gregorovic. His identity subsumed yours. Sliske never told you.",
    "I can only imagine. You've been Sliske's puppet for a thousand years.",
    "Well, there's a question of would it even matter if you were?",
    "Regardless, I think this must be pretty rare. I've killed the odd Abyssal in my time and none of them thought they were a person.",
    "So chances are, you're you, and I'm me.",
    "When I cured Senecianus, the other identity receded. Maybe if we cure Erasinus, we can destroy Gregorovic.",
    "Oh, I've been there.",
    "Can Greg be trusted?",
    "You are not to harm anyone. Anyone! Do you understand?",
    "For now.",
    "How are you holding up?",
    "Uhh.... it's complicated.",
    "I don't have any reason to interact with this right now.",
    "Hmm, what about picking the lock? I don't have any lockpicks on me, but maybe your claws could work?",
    "Hmm, I've got this lockpick here... but it looks too small for that lock. Maybe your claws could work instead?",
    "There must be a key around here somewhere.",
    "What should I be doing here again?",
    "Nothing.",
    "Okay, I'll go and have a look.",
    "I found this chain of keys.",
    "Only one small problem... There are way too many keys on here. We'll be here all day trying them one by one.",
    "I'll have a further look.",
    "I found this...less-than-straightforward set of instructions, describing different types of keys.",
    "I'll keep looking.",
    "I found this chain of keys, and some instructions describing what each key is used for.",
    "How are you?",
    "I can imagine. What became of the rest of the Nodon?",
    "I'm sorry.",
    "Ah. I'm familiar.",

    "Great, that's the gate open!",

    "No. I think you've had more than enough to eat today.",

    "Drat.",
    "Er... where to begin...",
    "I could ask you the same question.",
    "What are you talking about?",
    "What?",
    "I'm familiar with his work. I cured a demon of this condition once before.",
    "While we're here, demons have been attacking human patrols in the streets. Did you have anything to do with that?",
    "These were winged demons. Avernic.",
    "You seem distressed.",
    "I'm sorry. I can't pretend to know what the curse was like, but they must have been desperate. And being in those bodies for all this time would have only soured them more.",
    "What they did was horrific. I can't pretend to know what the curse was like, but there must have been humane solutions. Solutions that did not involve invading the body of another.",
    "I'm working on it.",
    "I'm going, I'm going.",
    "Hmm, I have the physical medicine here, but there must be more to it. Perhaps I should keep looking.",

    "What should I be doing?",
    "I haven't found anything.",

    "I found Senecianus in the asylum - it turns out I didn't cure him properly in the first place.",
    "He did give me this break curse scroll, though.",
    "I found a journal, from the Mahjarrat Nabor.",
    "I found some testing notes, from potion experiments.",
    "I found a bunch of testing notes, from potion experiments.",
    "I, uh... have this tube of blood... For a good cause...",
    "That seems to be everything.",
    "I created the medicine.",
    "I created the medicine, and found the Break Curse scroll.",

    "Lets leave the rest of the jars alone.",

    "There's nothing else of interest here.",
    "I don't want blood from here, who knows where it's from?",
    "Have you seen anything useful in the asylum?",
    "Hmm, they might be useful. Thanks.",
    "Hello.",
    "Hello?",
    "I'll, uh, keep an eye out.",
    "Hi there. Have you found anything?",
    "Have you found anything useful in the asylum?",
    "Lovely, thank you.",
    "I'm helping to look for the cure. Have you found anything?",
    "Can you help me? I'm also looking for the cure.",
    "Could you please move so I can search the bottles behind you?",
    "There there, who's a good... demon?",
    "Good... demon...",
    "AHH!",
    "...",
    "You could never, Eek.",

    "There she is again!",
    "Rowena!",
    "Where is she going?",
    "She seems to be going into that little room...",
    "Rowena? Senecianus?",
    "Yes, but which you?",
    "Why do you look like Rowena again?",
    "What are you doing down here?",
    "Of course. Hard to forget coming face-to-face with your true...beautiful...blobular self.",
    "That's not good. But then how are we able to talk?",
    "Is that why you're here? Looking for another cure?",
    "The other demons? Have you not spoken to them?",
    "Of course. They're here for the same reason you are.",
    "It sounds like it's a problem for them in the Abyss.",
    "Actually, also here for the same reason. We found someone called Erasinus, same condition.",
    "Thanks. The spell won't cure you permanently?",
    "Thanks. I already put together a potion that cures the physiological effects. I'm going to head back to the other demons now.",
    "I lost the Break Curse scroll.",
    "Will do.",
    "Not yet. I'll keep looking.",
    "This is barely legible. Senecianus really has awful handwriting.",
    "Hmm... I'll come back later.",
    "Hello.",
    "I've pieced together Nabor's research. I think I have a cure.",
    "We'll test it on Gregorovic and Senecianus.",
    "This is for the best, Greg. You need to find peace.",
    "Die, you monster.",
    "Here we go...",
    "Now to just...",
    "It worked!",
    "Are you both okay?",
    "Here's a sample of the cure. You should be able to create more.",
    "You mentioned you knew something about the demons in Senntisten?",
    "Uh-oh.",
    "Pretty bad. How many demons?",
    "Are they-",
    "Well... that's not what I expected. I need to report this to... someone.",
    "If Zamorak is planning some sort of invasion... demons aren't very good at minimising casualties.",
    "Yes, I'd better inform Saradomin.",
    "He deserves to know the fate of his knights at least.",
    "Before you go... do you remember being Gregorovic?",
    "Do you remember... me? The way he responded to me?",
    "He thought I was someone else.",
    "Why? The goddess Seren told me they weren't Sliske.",
    "Could I have the same disorder?",
    "Not exactly.",
    "Yes. There was this whole thing with Guthix and an Elder Artefact... and Sliske.",
    "Maybe I'll pop over too when I've sorted out this Zamorak problem.",
    "This isn't useful to me right now.",
    "I'd rather not speak to them right now.",
    "I'll come back later.",
    "I've been exploring the ruins of Senntisten.",
    "Zamorakian demons have been seen down there attacking your knights.",
    "A group of Abyssal demons told me that Zamorak has been moving his forces off Infernus, probably to Gielinor.",
    "An archaeological site? You mean the Star Lodge?",
    "It leads to the Infernal Source, an ancient demon summoning site in the Wilderness.",
    "You know me, I love an adventure.",
    "What should I be doing again?",
    "I should talk to the White Knights first, to prepare for whatever is down there.",
    "Have you seen anything out of the ordinary happening in the Star Cellar recently?",
    "You really haven't seen or heard anything?",
    "Likely story...",
    "Have you heard anything suspicious lately?",
    "Uh, you know... Demons, Zamorakians, and such.",
    "Interesting. Thanks for your time.",
    "Have you seen anything suspicious lately?",
    "Sheesh.",
    "Hi there. Have you seen anything suspicious around the dig site recently?",
    "I see. Thank you.",
    "Good day.",
    "Hello. Have you seen anything out of the ordinary near the dig site?",
    "Are biscuits...not ordinary around here?",
    "Right. This might be useful. Thank you.",
    "Hello. Saradomin sent me here to investigate some suspicious sightings reported by your troops.",
    "How was it ominous?",
    "I'll have a word with them. Thanks.",
    "I'm still investigating.",
    "Hello. Have you come across anything unusual around the dig site recently?",
    "That's helpful information, thanks.",
    "Are you okay?",
    "Ah, the cult? I'm here to join them too - go Zamorak!",
    "You know, you can always go back home if you don't want to do this.",
    "I'm sure they're welcoming to anyone willing to join, regardless of how well you can recall their cultural practices.",
    "Don't be so hard on yourself. I barely know the first thing about Zamorakian culture.",
    "If you insist...",
    "Growth through chaos.",
    "Movario.",
    "Francis Dashwood.",
    "Philippa Wharton.",
    "Zamorak.",
    "Dagon.",
    "Something like that.",
    "Safe travels!",
    "Mephisto.",
    "Growth through structure.",
    "Growth through cooperation.",
    "Uhh... I'm only Player, the biggest Zamorak supporter around. Haven't you heard of me?",
    "Fine. There must be some around here somewhere...",
    "I lost them.",
    "Er, greetings, fellow child of Zamorak.",
    "I am uh... excited to be here! You can call me Player.",
    "I lost them.",
    "I don't need to steal anything else right now.",
    "One ritual was more than enough.",
    "Psst.",
    "I'm Player. I can help you get out of here.",
    "Keep this on the down low, but I'm not actually in the cult.",
    "And, well, no one deserves to be handcuffed and tortured.",
    "I'll distract the guard and-",
    "I can find you some robes. Just hang in there.",
    "I happen to have some spare with me!",
    "Not yet.",
    "Here they are!",
    "They might not be the perfect fit, but this was the only size I could find.",
    "It's really nothing. Stay safe.",
    "Yeah... It's probably best if I don't touch that.",
    "There's no way I can get past it to access the Source. It's blocked off from top to bottom.",
    "And.... open sesame!",
    "I'll just grab this one... And this one... One size fits all, right?",
    "Best not be greedy, I've already taken some spare robes.",
    "I think I've found out all there is to know here. Time to go and update Saradomin.",
    "I'll come back later.",
    "Zamorak has taken back control of the Infernal Source.",
    "His cultists are swarming the dungeon. He's using the power he absorbed from the Eye of Het to summon demons from Infernus.",
    "A lot. Hundreds at least.",
    "He must have been planning this all along.",
    "Yes, Zamorak must be stopped.",
    "I have no quarrel with Zamorak, but I won't let demons kill civilians.",
    "Bilrach!",
    "Can you confront Zamorak directly?",
    "Can we destroy the Infernal Source? Damage it somehow?",
    "What if we just kill the attacking demons?",
    "I can kill demons.",
    "I understand.",
    "I know what we have to do.",
    "We're going to re-establish the Edicts of Guthix.",
    "I...don't know. Can I?",
    "We'll... I'll... figure something out.",
    "If you ever left, you wouldn't be able to return.",
    "I'm not committing to anything at this stage, but I'll investigate my options.",
    "Any ideas, guys?",
    "What should I be doing again?",
    "If there's one thing this conflict has done, it's made us reassess a few things. Saradomin as much as anyone.",
    "The Guardians...",
    "So I should ask the Guardians of Guthix. The trick will be getting them all in one place at a time.",
    "But the Edicts of Guthix have been kept secret for millennia. Relatively speaking, I've been a Guardian for all of five minutes. Will they trust me?",
    "I didn't even get invited to the meeting.",
    "I...suppose I am.",
    "Thanks for everything, Adrasteia.",
    "Goodbye, Adrasteia.",
    "Um... Hello?",
    "Okay. Guardians, I am here to ask for your help.",
    "Zamorak is summoning demons which present a deadly threat to the people of this world.",
    "The only way to stop them is to remove him, but the other gods don't like their chances.",
    "If we could re-establish the Edicts of Guthix, we could banish him.",
    "First we need to find out whether it's even possible.",
    "Catalyst? What do you mean?",
    "Wait...I'd have to cast the Edicts myself?",
    "I'm...ready if you are.",
    "So we test it. Perform a trial run.",
    "Juna?",
    "I was. Well, I found them at least.",
    "We...believe we may be able to re-instate the Edicts of Guthix.",
    "So...about that. The Guardians, collectively, hold the knowledge required to cast the Edicts. But they can't do it themselves.",
    "The Guardians' task was only to hold the information on the Edicts. Only Guthix's annointed[sic] representative on Gielinor can cast the spell itself.",
    "That's the World Guardian. So...me.",
    "Hey, I won't pretend I'm not terrified at the thought. But this needs to be done, and I'm the only one who can.",
    "What's more... I've stopped the Grand Revision. I've stood on the precipice of Erebus. How about you give me a chance?",
    "We're planning a series of test rituals, to see what I can do. And I won't be alone. The other Guardians will be there - Juna, Valluta, Fiara...",
    "For the tests, I need to find an appropriate site.",
    "I was hoping you might know such a place.",
    "For finding caches of treasure left by ancient gods? For uncovering the secrets of long-dead civilizations, lost for millennia?",
    "This... I shall take great care of this. And when I am done-",
    "Oh. So...how does it work?",
    "Still... This is incredible.",
    "Yes. Thank you, Saradomin.",
    "So... You know how you said you had lots of those devices?",
    "I... Yes.",
    "What? Really?",
    "Nothing yet.",
    "Right. I'll get back to it, then.",
    "Right. Here goes...",
    "Huh. The compass is just spinning. What was it Saradomin said? I need to be on Gielinor's surface...",
    "We're looking for a location to test the Edicts of Guthix ritual.",
    "The Hall of Memories seemed a likely spot, given its concentration of divine energy. Sure enough, Saradomin's compass sent me here.",
    "I see. Thank you, Archivist.",
    "This feels like the right place.",
    "What's that wisp? It's....[sic]green?",
    "Um... Hello.",
    "I need a place to test the new Edicts of Guthix. Saradomin's compass led me here, so...",
    "Could we at least try?",
    "Let's - ah - try somewhere else, then.",
    "Easy! I'm not here to fight.",
    "I am searching for a test site for a magical ritual.",
    "I've been led here by a device given to me by Saradomin. I'm hoping that this is the place we need.",
    "So... May we test the ritual here?",
    "Thank you, Merethiel.",

    "Great. Thanks.",
    "...",
    "I'll...let Ocellus know.",
    "I think I've lost the crate.",
    "Oh. Thanks.",
    "We're banishing live birds? That's terrible! I've...got sort of attached to them.",

    "It does... somehow... smell like me though.",
    "That didn't feel quite right.",
    "Nope, that wasn't it",
    "Hmm, let's try again",
    "W-wow...",
    "It's...hard to describe.",
    "It was definitely starting to work, though. I could feel the threshold at which it would start to work.",
    "From reaching that point...I could tell the ritual would only affect entities over a certain power level. True gods.",
    "The energies involved here... Even for this weakened ritual, they're incredible. Once they're in motion there's nothing much I can do to stop them.",
    "I will be able to start the ritual and complete the spell - that's for certain. But I won't be able to control it beyond that - only let it run its course.",
    "M-me?",
    "That's great, but I'm out here performing the ritual. How are we going to-",
    "Ocellus... What is this? How did you- Is that my hair?",
    "Wait, I-",
    "No, stop-",
    "AAAAARGH!",
    "I... I...",
    "It felt...like I was being turned inside-out. Like part of me was being...",
    "Like last time. Once the spell was cast, I couldn't control it. It went beyond... Beyond what it was meant to do.",
    "If I do this, Juna... It'll take my World Guardian powers.",
    "If that's what it takes to stop Zamorak. Of course.",
    "Also... I get the impression it's what Guthix would have wanted.",
    "Thank you, Juna. That means...something, at least.",
    "I don't need to do anything with this right now.",
    "I'll come back later.",
    "Where is Saradomin? I need to speak with him.",
    "Essentially... Yes.",
    "The Guardians were able to pass their knowledge of the Edicts on to me. I understand the ritual, and how to enact it.",
    "We enacted a scaled-down version of the ritual, and tested its results upon accordingly resonant divine objects.",
    "I... I can do it. I can cast the ritual.",
    "The ritual was designed only to work on beings with a certain concentration of divine energy. So it'll have no effect on demigods, Mahjarrat - that sort of thing.",
    "Yes. And no.",
    "The energies of the spell are staggering. My powers let me cast the spell without being destroyed, but I am not Guthix. I can't moderate the effect the way he did.",
    "I mean that I can set the spell going, but I can't control it.",
    "The Edicts I cast won't just stop gods re-entering Gielinor. They'll banish them.",
    "Sorry, but no. Once I cast the spell, my World Guardian powers go with it. It's strictly a one-time thing.",
    "Don't worry. I've got this.",
    "Oh.",
    "Yes please.",
    "Not right now.",
    "I'm here.",
    "Let me get straight to the point.",
    "I can re-establish the Edicts of Guthix.",
    "Guthix controlled the Edicts very precisely, presumably so that he could offer you a choice to leave of your own will.",
    "I don't have that control. If I go ahead with the ritual, all the gods will be banished.",
    "But once you're gone, you won't be able to return.",
    "Because it affects all of you.",
    "You do.",
    "No. The Edicts can only be re-established at the Edicts Monument, deep in the Wilderness.",
    "I will face Zamorak. Alone, if I have to.",
    "I defeated Jas. I fought Seren and lived. I survived the Great Revision itself.",
    "I am the World Guardian.",
    "I don't need to defeat him. I just need to hold him off until I can perform the ritual and banish him.",
    "Not even slightly.",
    "No more so than usual.",
    "I'll go in, probably wing it, figure it out as I go along.",
    "Oh, that's what you guys are?",
    "I was sure you were the disembodied presence of Sliske.",
    "Or I was going crazy.",
    "Could you not have told me this earlier?",

    "Maybe we should hurry.",
    "Let's go.",
    "Alright, don't take too long.",
    "So, only one problem. Someone's locked the entrance.",

    "Let's see...",

    "Perfect. What are you waiting for? Go and open the gate!",
    "Hm. Maybe someone left instructions nearby?",
    "Intriguing. There must be some keys nearby, then.",

    "I couldn't figure out how to free them from Kerapac's dreamscape.",

    "I plan to move to Orthen, when the time is right. While helping the Nodon back to their pods, I was introduced to some intriguing characters.",
    "Vicendithas and Hannibus, they're called.",
    "Vicendithas seems wonderfully intelligent. As for Hannibus, well, let's just say I've met more captivating people on the body carts in Senntisten.",
    "He does, however, have experience with my kin's dreamscape technology. I'm hopeful that the pair could assist me in awakening them.",

    "Not that I can blame the humans, but it was so refreshing to meet someone who didn't have any sense of wariness around me.",

    "Another problem. Looks like these strange creatures are roaming the area.",
    "I suppose that's the best way to go about this.",
    "See what you can learn without being spotted. Erasinus and I will follow when the path is clear.",
    "What are you waiting for? See if you can find anything in the area. Watch out for the Abyssals, though.",
    "Dahaka...?",
    "Yakla? Yakla!",
    "By the Roakin! Yakla? What have you done to yourself?",

    "In stolen bodies. You returned to the Abyss? Have you been there all this time?",
    "Wasn't he buried with Varanus?",
    "He has two different personalities. Player says he's this monstrous creature, but he's always been very gentle around me.",
    "I just... Can't believe they would do something so barbaric. My own kind. These were dragonkin I thought I knew.",
    "I knew about the experiments they were doing but I thought it was just curiosity. To steal the bodies of other beings.",
    "You might be right. And as shocking as it is, I'd be lying to myself if I didn't feel slightly relieved to see more of my 'kin' alive and well.",
    "Exactly. If my kin managed to figure out a solution, then they could have done the same. There's no excuse for this atrocious act.",
    "But, we have something else to focus on right now. Let's look around and see what we can find.",
    "Hello, Player. What's going on?",
    "What have you found so far?",
    "Keep looking around the whole asylum. There must be something of use somewhere...",
    "That should be helpful, to know what it is exactly we're trying to cure.",

    "Great. Those should surely help!",
    "Right... Well, I trust that will help with the medicine...",
    "Great! But that can't be all there is to it - keep looking.",
    "That must be everything! You should hand it over to the leaders.",

    "Hey! Watch what you're doing with that.",

    "I'll admit, my first judgement of Hannibus may have been too harsh. He has been understandably hurting from the loss of his homeworld.",
    "Despite this, he and the ilujanka have been most friendly, welcoming me into this community with open arms.",
    "Vicendithas has also been a most captivating mind to pick at. We've butted heads a few times, mainly over his research theories, but there's been no real hostility.",
    "It's a bit more mossy and rubbly than I remember, but it still feels like home... Just without my old friends and family.",

    "Not yet.",

    "Yes - and what a work of wonder it is!",
    "I may have had my doubts beforehand, but now seeing what can be achieved... I have full confidence we can find the answer to free my kin.",
    "Well luckily for you, I have a replacement.",

    "We could. Armadyl would help, and Azzanadra has no love for Zamorak, but even we cannot be everywhere at once.",

    "If we do not cut the problem off at the head, we are simply delaying the inevitable.",
    "I have no doubt. But you are no god, and if these reports are to be believed...",
    "Even with Armadyl's help... I cannot confront Zamorak and save my people from destruction at the same time.",
    "What was that, World Guardian?",
    "Can you do that?",
    "Can you?",
    "After he established the Edicts, Guthix forced each of us to leave in turn.",
    "If you can re-establish them, then Armadyl and I can push Zamorak through his own portal and close it.",

    "Being trapped here is a small price to pay to be rid of Zamorak.",
    "Hush, Garlandia. Soon the God Wars will finally be over. Soon we will have peace.",
    "Go then, World Guardian. I will defend the cities, save as many as I can.",

    "Go just down the stairs and talk to Adrasteia, she may be able to help you with the Edicts.",
    "Adrasteia tells me you have sought out the Guardians of Guthix. I trust you were successful?",
    "And?",
    "I see. It has come to this, then.",
    "We have discussed our plan. The Edicts will be enacted. Then, Armadyl and I will eject Zamorak from the world. I trust we still have this accord?",
    "Go on.",
    "You?",
    "With all due respect...the Edicts must involve energies far beyond anything any mortal has ever wielded.",
    "This isn't some opportunity to show off. Do you have any idea how utterly catastrophic a misstep here could be? And not just for the gods - for the world!",
    "...",
    "Fine.",
    "Then what can I do to help?",
    "Yes... It would be necessary to find somewhere with appropriately clement magical conditions.",
    "The Crown Archival allowed me to divine the presence of Elder Artefacts. It was also useful for lesser scrying.",
    "More like the divine equivalent of losing one's keys.",
    "I have missed the convenience it once afforded me, and have since designed a simple device for performing such mundane functions.",
    "You don't seem to have any space in your backpack. Come back and talk to me when you do.",
    "Keep it. I have plenty of them.",
    "On activation, it will permanently attune itself to that which you currently seek. Keep your goal firmly in mind. Try to make sure you aren't craving a sandwich or anything.",
    "The scanner will lead you to a likely destination. If incorrect, it will recalibrate to another to another on arrival.",
    "This may take a few attempts. You must also be on Gielinor's surface. Otherwise, it will not work.",
    "Note that it is of no further use once your goal is reached, and may be discarded.",
    "And there we have it. The device is crude, but it should serve your purpose.",
    "Yes, we gods have our uses. Some of us even want the best for this world...despite everything. I ask that you remember this, as you do what must be done.",
    "Now go, and leave me with my thoughts.",
    "Thank me by stopping Zamorak. By saving Gielinor.",
    "You've lost it?",
    "You don't seem to have any space in your backpack. Come back and talk to me when you do.",
    "You know, using one of these shortens your life by 30 minutes.",
    "Well... No. Probably not.",
    "Just take more care from now on, hm? Time is very much of the essence.",
    "How goes the search?",
    "Well, don't give up. Keep following the scanner. It should take you to the right place. Eventually.",
    "No need. I am here.",
    "Armadyl, Azzanadra and I have been holding against the onslaught, but the tide is endless.",
    "What of the Edicts? Were your tests successful?",
    "And?",
    "But it will affect Zamorak? Our plan will work?",
    "Explain.",
    "The plan could still work. We gods could leave... imprison Zamorak... you could reverse the spell...",
    "NO! This will NOT come to pass! There is too much to be done, too many iniquities to-",
    "Garlandia...",
    "She is right, Adrasteia.",
    "Peace, dear one. Neither you - nor anyone else - need make excuses for me ever again.",
    "Zamorak...",
    "Zamorak revels in his own depravity and tyranny. But despite his purported forthrightness, there is one secret he holds close. One thing he would never admit.",
    "I am as responsible for his actions as he is.",
    "Zamorak feeds on rivalry - craves conflict and adversity. And what greater rival has he than I?",
    "While I hold true to my ideals, I can only fan those flames. And without my ideals I am nothing.",
    "So establish your Edicts, World Guardian. Zamorak will be cast from this world, and I with him.",
    "He wants war? So shall he have it. The firmament shall tremble with every blow we deal one another, and our battle shall echo through eternity.",
    "But this world will be safe.",
    "A grave threat indeed. But I leave this world in the most capable of hands.",
    "I didn't mean you.",
    "We must inform the other gods - in person.",
    "I will summon them to the Empyrean Citadel. Meet us there, quickly. Every moment away from the front, more of my people die.",
    "I don't know about you, but I have no taste for theatrics.",
    "This is... the World Guardian's plan. They can explain when they get here.",
    "There's a catch.",
    "I don't think so. It'll take time.",
    "Yes. On reflection, this is the only course available to us.",
    "This is bigger than me. Than all of us.",
    "Besides, if I'm going to be trapped out there with you, I'd rather not start as enemies.",
    "So what say you? Does the World Guardian have your assent?",
    "Icthlarin?",
    "Azzanadra?",
    "Zamorak has shielded the entire crater. I tested it myself.",
    "We need to get the World Guardian inside the shield.",
    "My people will find a way.",
    "We cannot. Even with the power we absorbed from the eggs the fight would be a long and gruelling one.",
    "Go then, make what preparations you can. You will be contacted when we've found a way inside the shield.",
    "I must return to my people."

    "We shall see. But for now... Well, you of all people have earned my trust. If you say this bears investigation... I will tell you what little I know.",
    "So... Father has taught me a great deal, but magic of a high god such as Guthix... It defies mortal comprehension.",
    "No written record of the Edicts exists, of course. Their purpose was to keep the gods away from Gielinor.",
    "Only those in Guthix's closest confidence would have been privy to such information.",
    "Yes. Immortal beings, powerful and unfailingly loyal. Who better to bear the knowledge? It could even be split among them, so if one fell the whole truth was not lost.",
    "That part, at least, is fairly simple. The world's factions are all meeting to discuss their responses to this new threat.",
    "The Guardians of Guthix are no exception - we've received word that they're meeting by the Tree of Balance, south-east of Varrock.",
    "You are a mortal being imbued with divine power by Guthix himself, yes?",
    "The thing about divine energy is it can't be created or destroyed. It never really stops being part of the god it came from.",
    "Guthix may not be here, but he lives on - in you, and in each of the other Guardians.",
    "You share an immutable bond - one that, with any luck, will garner some empathy and understanding.",
    "Speak with your fellow Guardians - I'm sure they'll listen. If anyone can convinve them of this, it's you.",
    "Oh - when you get there, just speak to the Tree of Balance. It'll direct you to the meeting.",

    "Welcome, World Guardian.",

    "We have been dealing with a[sic] intermediary: the Kinshra requisitions officer, Isaura. She's been holding them for us until we could confirm the location.",
    "Isaura has made a long and lucrative career out of...tactical ignorance. She is able to procure almost any item, and asks no more questions than she needs to.",

    "In the grove, there is not sufficient power to actually complete the ritual to establish the Edicts - only a scaled-down facsimile.",
    "Nonetheless, we must take care. I propose that we test the ritual in three stages: starting out with four runes, then five, then six.",
    "The effigies placed in the centre each resonate with the power of its represented god or divine being. They should show the effect that the real ritual will have, when the time comes.",
    "You are correct, of course. To banish a creature without means of survival would be cruel.",
    "These rare birds, however, have an inherent homing trait that sends them back to their world of origin, should they be exposed to chaotic teleportation magic.",
    "Since we needed living matter, I requested them specifically - and at considerable expense.",
    "In dire times, holding onto our ethics is what sets us apart from our enemies.",
    "Now... The ritual itself should be relatively simple.",
    "Take materials from the cart and build the platforms. Start with four. We will increase this as we progress.",
    "To prepare, gather divine energy from the springs and craft Guthixian runes. These aren't physical objects, but will be made available to you when you need them.",
    "Add the runes to the platforms, then initiate the ritual at the centre of the grove. You must complete three words for each ritual.",
    "Experiment, observe the results, and find the words needed to complete the rituals.",
    "We have a journal for you. However, you don't have enough space to hold it.",
    "We have combined our knowledge of the runes into this journal. Hopefully it will help with the rituals.",

    "We have a journal for you. However you don't have enough space to hold it.",
    "Please be more careful with this one.",
    "World Guardian. How goes the ritual?",
    "You must set up the platforms before the ritual may be attempted. Simply take materials from the cart and build the platforms in the designated spots.",
    "You will need four for the first phase, five for the second, and six for the final push.",
    "Place an appropriate test object in the circle at the centre of the grove, then activate the circle.",
    "Gather energy from the springs. Then, access the artefact in the centre of the grove and craft the runes you need.",
    "The word's length will be determined by the number of platforms active.",
    "Place runes onto the platforms to form words.",
    "It would be for the real ritual.",
    "Look at the colours of the runes you have placed.",
    "Green means the rune is in the correct place.",
    "Amber means the rune is part of the correct word, but incorrectly placed.",
    "Grey means the rune is not part of the correct word.",
    "Red means the rune is in the correct place.",
    "Purple means the rune is part of the correct word, but incorrectly placed.",
    "Grey means the rune is not part of the correct word.",

    "Alas, we are in uncharted territory. Just do not give up! Think calmly and logically, and I am certain you shall prevail.",
    "We don't require that platform just yet.",
    "You will need that crate of birds from Isaura.",
    "You will need the doll-alike from Ocellus.",
    "Enough.",
    "Yes. All will remain when we succeed.",
    "Good. We have tested the foundations of the ritual. Now, we must take it further.",
    "Place the effigies of the gods in the circle. Then attempt the ritual with one more rune - five in total.",
    "Take care, World Guardian - and good luck.",
    "Stop! Enough!",
    "As I suspected. When we complete this, all gods who have not already left Gielinor will leave. Whether they want to or not.",
