  "Gossip": [
    "There's some kind of commotion up at the Sinclair place I hear. Not surprising all things considered.",
    "Murder is it? Well, I'm not really surprised...",
    "Well, what do you want to know?",
    "Well, they used to live in the big castle, but old Lord Sinclair gave it up so that those strange knights could live there instead. So the king built him a new house to the North. It's more cramped than his old place, but he seemed to like it. His children were furious at him for doing it though!",
    "His sons eh? They all have their own skeletons in their cupboards. You'll have to be more specific. Who are you interested in exactly?",
    "Bob is an odd character indeed... I'm not one to gossip, but I heard Bob is addicted to Tea. He can't make it through the day without having at least 20 cups! You might not think that's such a big thing, but he has spent thousands of gold to feed his habit! At one point he stole a lot of silverware from the kitchen and pawned it just so he could afford to buy his daily tea allowance. If his father ever found out, he would be in so much trouble... he might even get disowned!",
    "David... oh David... not many people know this, but David really has an anger problem. He's always screaming and shouting at the household servants when he's angry, and they live in a state of fear, always walking on eggshells around him, but none of them have the courage to talk to his father about his behaviour. If they did, Lord Sinclair would almost certainly kick him out of the house, as some of the servants have been there longer than he has, and he definitely has no right to treat them like he does... but I'm not one to gossip about people.",
    "I'm not one to talk ill of people behind their back, but Frank is a real piece of work. He is an absolutely terrible gambler...he can't pass 2 dogs in the street without putting a bet on which one will bark first! He has already squandered all of his allowance, and I heard he had stolen a number of paintings of his fathers to sell to try and cover his debts, but he still owes a lot of people a lot of money. If his father ever found out, he would stop his income, and then he would be in serious trouble!",
    "His daughters eh? They're all nasty pieces of work, which of them specifically did you want to know about?",
    "Anna... ah yes... Anna has 2 great loves: Sewing and gardening. But one thing she has kept secret is that she once had an affair with Stanford the gardener, and tried to get him fired when they broke up by killing all of the flowers in the garden. If her father ever found out she had done that he would be so furious he would probably disown her.",
    "Oh Carol... she is such a fool. You didn't hear this from me, but I heard a while ago she was conned out of a lot of money by a travelling salesman who sold her a box full of beans by telling her they were magic. But they weren't. She sold some rare books from the library to cover her debts, but her father would be incredibly annoyed if he ever found out \u2013 he might even throw her out of the house!",
    "Elizabeth? Elizabeth has a strange problem... She cannot help herself, but is always stealing small objects \u2013 it's pretty sad that she is rich enough to afford to buy things, but would rather steal them instead. Now, I don't want to spread stories, but I heard she even stole a silver needle from her father that had great sentimental value for him. He was devastated when it was lost, and cried for a week thinking he had lost it! If he ever found out that it was her who had stolen it he would go absolutely mental, maybe even disowning her!",
    "Well, I guess it could have been an intruder, but with that big guard dog of theirs I seriously doubt it. I suspect it was someone closer to home... Especially as I heard that the poison salesman in the Seers' village made a big sale to one of the family the other day.",
    "And I think you've been reading too many cheap detective novels. Hobbes is kind of uptight, but his loyalty to old Lord Sinclair is beyond question.",
    "Well, I don't know if it's related, but I heard from that Poison Salesman in town that he sold some poison to one of the Sinclair family the other day. I don't think he has any stock left now though...",
    "Well, this might be of some help to you. My father was in the guards when he was younger and he always said that there isn't a crime that can't be solved through careful examination of the crime scene and all surrounding areas."

  "Guard": [
    "Oh, it's terrible! Lord Sinclair has been murdered and we don't have any clues as to who or why. We're totally baffled! If you can help us we will be very grateful.",
    "Thanks a lot!",

    "Look around and investigate who might be responsible. The Sarge said every murder leaves clues to who done it, but frankly we're out of our depth here.",
    "Well, it's all very mysterious. Mary, the maid, found the body in the study next to his bedroom on the east wing of the ground floor.",
    "The door was found locked from the inside, and he seemed to have been stabbed, but there was an odd smell in the room. Frankly, I'm stumped.",
    "Really? That was quick work! Who?",
    "I hope you have proof to that effect. We have to arrest someone for this and it seems to me that only the actual murderer would gain by falsely accusing someone.",
    "Although having said that the butler is kind of shifty looking...",
    "That's some good work there. I guess it wasn't a servant. You still haven't proved who did do it though.",
    "Oh really? How did you get that?",
    "Hmm. That's some good detective work there. We need more evidence before we can close the case though. Keep up the good work!",
    "You do? That's excellent work. Let's hear it then.",

    "Yes, that makes sense. But who did do it then?",

    "Excellent work \u2013 have you considered a career as a detective? But I'm afraid it's still not quite enough...",
    "Yes. There's no doubt about it. It must have been [suspect] who killed [his/her] father. All of the guards must congratulate you on your excellent work in helping us to solve this case. We don't have many murders here in RuneScape and I'm afraid we wouldn't have been able to solve it by ourselves. We will hold her here under house arrest until such time as we bring her to trial. You have our gratitude, and I'm sure the rest of the family's as well, in helping to apprehend the murderer. I'll just take the evidence from you now.",
    "Please accept this reward from the family!",
    "Excellent work on solving the murder! All of the guards I know are very impressed, and don't worry, we have the murderer under guard until they can be taken to trial.",

    "It was clearly an intruder.",
    "It was one of our lazy servants then.",
    "In the library. No one else was there so you'll just have to take my word for it.",
    "It's some Green thread. It's not exactly uncommon is it? My trousers are made of the same material.",
    "Not really, no. Thread is fairly common.",
    "That useless Gardener Stanford let his compost heap fester. It's an eyesore to the garden! So I bought some poison from a travelling salesman so that I could kill off some of the wildlife living in it."
  ],
  "Bob": [
    "I suppose I had better talk to you then.",
    "I don't really care as long as no one thinks it's me. Maybe it was that strange poison seller who headed towards the seers village.",

    "No. But I was.",
    "It's some red thread. I suppose you think that's some kind of clue? It looks like the material my trousers are made of.",
    "What's it to you anyway? If you absolutely must know, we had a problem with the beehive in the garden, and as all of our servants are so pathetically useless, I decided I would deal with it myself. So I did."

  "Carol": [
    "Well, ask what you want to know then.",
    "I don't know. I think it's very convenient that you have arrived here so soon after it happened. Maybe it was you.",

    "It's some red thread... it kind of looks like the Same material as my trousers. But obviously it's not.",
    "I don't see what on earth it has to do with you, but the drain outside was blocked, and as nobody else here has the intelligence to even unblock a simple drain I felt I had to do it myself."

    "And? Make this quick. I have better things to do than be interrogated by halfwits all day.",
    "I don't really know or care. Frankly, the old man deserved to die. There was a suspicious red headed man who came to the house the other day selling poison now I think about it. Last I saw he was headed towards the tavern in the Seers village.",
    "That is none of your business. Are we finished now, or are you just going to stand there irritating me with your idiotic questions all day?",
    "No. Can I go yet? Your face irritates me.",
    "There was a nest of spiders upstairs between the two servants' quarters. Obviously I had to kill them before our pathetic servants whined at my father some more. Honestly, it's like they expect to be treated like royalty! If I had my way I would fire the whole workshy lot of them!"

  "Donovan the Family Handyman": [
    "How can I help?",
    "Oh... I really couldn't say. I wouldn't really want to point any fingers at anybody. If I had to make a guess I'd have to say it was probably Bob though. I saw him arguing with Lord Sinclair about some missing silverware from the Kitchen. It was a very heated argument.",
    "Me? I was sound asleep here in the servants Quarters. It's very hard work as a handyman around here. There's always something to do!",
    "Hmmm... No, I didn't, but I sleep very soundly at night.",
    "Now you mention it, no. It is odd I didn't hear anything like that. But I do sleep very soundly as I said and wouldn't necessarily have heard it if there was any such noise.",
    "Well, I do know Frank bought some poison recently to clean the family crest that's outside. It's very old and rusty, and I couldn't clean it myself, so he said he would buy some cleaner and clean it himself. He probably just got some from that Poison Salesman who came to the door the other day... You'd really have to ask him though."

    "It's some thread. You're not very good at this whole investigation thing are you?",

    "I don't know, somewhere around here probably. Could you spare me a few coins? I'll be able to pay you back double tomorrow it's just there's this poker night tonight in town...",
    "It looks like thread to me, but I'm not exactly an expert. Is it worth something? Can I have it? Actually, can you spare me a few gold?",
    "Would you like to buy some? I'm kind of strapped for cash right now. I'll sell it to you cheap. It's hardly been used at all. I just used a bit to clean that family crest outside up a bit. Do you think I could get much money for the family crest, actually? It's cleaned up a bit now."
  ],
  "Hobbes": [
    "How can I help?",
    "well, in my considered opinion it must be David. The man is nothing more than a bully. And I happen to know that poor Lord Sinclair and David had a massive argument in the living room about the way he treats the staff, the other day. I did not intend to overhear their conversation, but they were shouting so loudly I could not help but Overhear it. David definitely used the words 'I am going to kill you!' as well. I think he should be the prime suspect. He has a nasty temper that one.",
    "I was assisting the cook with the evening meal. I have Mary His Lordships' dinner, and sent her to take it to him, then heard the scream as she found the body.",
    "How do you mean 'suspicious'?",
    "No, I definitely didn't hear anything like that.",
    "You know, now you come to mention it I don't believe I did. I suppose that is Proof enough that it could not have been an intruder who is responsible."

  "Louisa": [
    "How can I help?",
    "Elizabeth. Her father confronted her about her constant petty thieving, and was devastated to find she had stolen a silver needle which had meant a lot to him. You could hear their argument from Lumbridge!",

    "I told Carol to buy some from that strange poison salesman and clean the drains before they began to smell any worse. She was the one who blocked them in the first place with a load of beans that she bought for some reason. There were far too many to eat, and they were almost rotten when she bought them anyway! You'd really have to ask her though."

    "I was with Hobbes and Louisa in the Kitchen helping to prepare Lord Sinclair's meal, and then when I took it to his study... I saw... oh, it was horrible... he was...",

    "Well, like what?",
    "No, I don't remember hearing anything like that.",

    "Well, I know David said that he was going to do something about the spiders' nest that's between the two servants' quarters upstairs. He made a big deal about it to Mary the Maid, calling her useless and incompetent. I felt quite sorry for her actually. You'd really have to ask him though."

  "Stanford": [
    "How can I help?",
    "It was Anna. She is seriously unbalanced. She trashed the garden once then tried to blame it on me! I bet it was her. It's just the kind of thing she'd do! She really hates me and was arguing with Lord Sinclair about trashing the garden a few days ago.",

  "Poison Salesman": [
    "There was a murder at the Sinclair house??? That's terrible! And I was only there the other day too! They bought the last of my Patented Multi Purpose Poison!",
    "Aaaaah... a miracle of modern apothecaries! This exclusive concoction has been tested on all known forms of life and been proven to kill them all in varying dilutions from cockroaches to king dragons! So incredibly versatile, it can be used as pest control, a cleansing agent, drain cleaner, metal polish and washes whiter than white, all with our uniquely fragrant concoction that is immediately recognisable across the land as Peter Potter's Patented Poison potion!!!",
    "I'd love to sell you some but I've sold out recently. That's just how good it is! Three hundred and twenty eight people in this area alone cannot be wrong! Nine out of Ten poisoners prefer it in controlled tests! Can I help you with anything else? Perhaps I can take your name and add it to our mailing list of poison users? We will only send you information related to the use of poison and other Peter Potter Products!",
    "Well, Peter Potter's Patented Multi Purpose Poison is a product of such obvious quality that I am glad to say I managed to sell a bottle to each of the Sinclairs! Anna, Bob, Carol, David, Elizabeth and Frank all bought a bottle! In fact they bought the last of my supplies! Maybe I can take your name and address and I will personally come and visit you when stocks return?",
    "I'm afraid I am totally out of stock at the moment after my successful trip to the Sinclairs' House the other day. But don't worry! Our factories are working overtime to produce Peter Potter's Patented Multi Purpose Poison! Possibly the finest multi purpose poison and cleaner yet available to the general market. And its unique fragrance makes it the number one choice for cleaners and exterminators the whole country over!",
    "Hmmm... yes, that smells exactly like my Patented Multi Purpose Poison, but I don't see how it could be. It quite clearly says on the label of all bottles 'Not to be taken internally \u2013 EXTREMELY POISONOUS'.",
