    "Hello, are you ok?",
    "Lost whom?",
    "Who's Fluffs?",
    "What's in it for me?",
    "Just a meal? It's not the best offer I've had, but I suppose I can help.",
    "Well, I suppose I could, though I'd need more details.",
    "The marketplace? Which one would that be? It would help to know what they get up to, as well.",
    "Alright then. I'll see what I can do. Two young lads in Varrock Marketplace; I can only hope that there's no school trip passing through when I arrive.",
    "Sorry, I'm too busy to play pet rescue.",
    "Hello Gertrude.",
    "I'm afraid not.",
    "No sign of him either.",
    "Hello there.",
    "Have you seen Fluffs?",
    "She's your mummy's cat.",
    "Right. Bye Kanel.",
    "Hello, what's your name?",
    "Err, hello there. What's that you have there?",
    "What a nice dragon, have you seen Fluffs little boy?",
    "I see. I don't think this is the most helpful clue I have ever been given.",
    "Hello there, I've been looking for you and it's important.",
    "Hello there, I've been looking for you.",
    "What? I'm trying to help your mum find some cat called Fluffs.",
    "Where is this secret hideout? I really need to find that cat for your mum.",
    "From my limited knowledge of the law, they are not usually involved in manhunts for children.",
    "Tell me sonny, or I will inform your mum you are criminals.",
    "I'm an upstanding citizen!",
    "What will make you tell me?",
    "How much?",
    "100 coins! What sort of expensive things do you need that badly?",
    "Why should I pay you then, can you answer that as easily?",
    "I'm not paying you a thing.",
    "Okay then, I'll pay, but I'll want you to tell your mother what a nice person I am.",
    "I'll want you to tell your mother what a nice person I am so she rewards me for this search.",
    "There you go, now where did you see Fluffs?",
    "Anything else?",
    "Well, never mind, it's Fluffs' loss.",
    "Where did you say you saw Fluffs?",
    "Hello Gertrude.",
    "He does seem quite a handful.",
    "I think so. I'm just going to look now.",
    "Ouch!",
    "Ouch!",
    "I've found Fluffs but she won't come back home with me. Any ideas?",
    "Hello Gertrude.",
    "He does seem quite a handful.",
    "Yes, I've found Fluffs!",
    "She's still in Varrock. I think she may be hungry, thirsty or both.",
    "Doogle sardines?",
    "What if she is thirsty?",
    "It seems a rather large amount of milk for one small cat, but I'll give it a try.",
    "Progress at least.",
    "Ouch!",
    "Ouch!",
    "Hello again.",
    "Yes, I've found Fluffs!",
    "Well, that's the thing, she refuses to leave.",
    "Doogle sardines?",
    "Progress, at least.",
    "Ouch!",
    "She seems to be a very fussy cat.",
    "She seems to be a very fussy cat.",
    "She seems to be a very fussy cat.",
    "Hi!",
    "Yeah, she loved them, but she still won't leave.",
    "Ouch!",
    "Hello, Gertrude. Fluffs had run off with her kittens, lost them and I have now returned them to her.",
    "That's ok, I like to do my bit.",
    "You're going to give me a kitten? Thanks.",
    "There you go, now where did you see Fluffs?",
    "Anything else?",
    "Where did you say you saw Fluffs?",
    "She's still at the Lumber Yard. I think she may be hungry, thirsty or both.",
    "Ouch!",
    "I'm looking for a cat named Fluffs and my sources tell me she may be in your sawmill."

    "Do I look ok? Those kids drive me crazy. I'm sorry. It's just that I've lost her.",
    "Fluffs, poor Fluffs. She never hurt anyone.",
    "My beloved feline friend, Fluffs. She's been purring by my side for almost a decade. Please, could you go and search for her while I take care of the children?",
    "I'm sorry, I'm too poor to pay you anything, the best I could offer is a warm meal. So, can you help?",
    "I suppose I could give you some nice, yummy chocolate cake; maybe even a kitten too, if you seem like a nice sort. Is that something you could be persuaded with?",
    "Really? Thank you so much! I really have no idea where she could be! I think my sons, Shilop and Wilough, saw the cat last. They'll be out in the marketplace.",
    "Really? Well, I generally let them do what they want, so I've no idea exactly what they would be doing. They are good lads, though. I'm sure they are just watching the passers-by in Varrock Marketplace. Oh, to be young and carefree again!",
    "Well, okay then. I'll have to find someone else; someone less heartless. It will be on your conscience if a poor kitty is lost in the wilds, though.",
    "Have you seen my poor Fluffs?",
    "What about Shilop?",
    "Hmmm, strange; he should be in Varrock Marketplace.",
    "Hello again, did you manage to find Shilop? I can't keep an eye on him for the life of me.",
    "You have no idea! Did he help at all?",
    "Thanks again, adventurer.",
    "Hello again, did you manage to find Shilop? I can't keep an eye on him for the life of me.",
    "You have no idea! Did he help at all?",
    "That's great; where is she?",
    "Oh dear, oh dear! Maybe she's just hungry. She loves doogle sardines but I'm all out.",
    "Yes, raw sardines seasoned with doogle leaves. Unfortunately, I've used all my doogles leaves, but you may find some on the bush out back.",
    "In that case, she'd probably like some milk. A bucketful would tempt her, I'm sure.",
    "Hello. How's it going? Any luck?",
    "Well well, you are clever! Did you bring her back?",
    "Oh dear, oh dear! Maybe she's just hungry. She loves doogle sardines but I'm all out.",
    "Yes, raw sardines seasoned with doogle leaves. Unfortunately, I've used all my doogles leaves, but you may find some on the bush out back.",
    "Hey traveller, did Fluffs eat the sardines?",
    "Well that is strange, there must be a reason.",
    "Thank you! If you hadn't found her kittens then they would have died out there. I've got some presents for you in thanks for your help.",
    "I have no real material possessions but I do have kittens. I've cooked you some food too.",
    "I would sell one to my cousin in West Ardougne, I hear there's a rat epidemic there but it's too far for me to travel, what with my boys and all.",
    "Oh, by the way, the kitten can live in your backpack but, to ensure it grows, you must take it out, feed it and stroke it often."

    "If I told you that, it wouldn't be a secret. What if I need to escape from the law? I need a hideout.",
    "Well it's still mine anyway, we need a place to relax sometimes. Those two little brothers at the house are just such babies.",
    "W..wh..what?! Y..you wouldn't! Anyway, I'll deny it all and she'll be sure to believe me over some wandering killer like you.",
    "And I'm even more her favourite than he is!",

    "Obviously you shouldn't pay that much, but I won't help otherwise. I never liked that cat anyway, fussy scratchy thing it is, so what do you say?",
    "Okay then, I'll find another way to make money. You only have yourself to blame if I'm forced into a life of crime.",
