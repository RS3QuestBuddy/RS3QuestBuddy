    "It's good to see you're passionate.",
    "You mentioned you're a born leader. How do you demonstrate this quality?",
    "Hmm...",
    "Imagine this situation. A guard under your command has disobeyed an order to patrol the fort walls, and instead spent the day at a gnome ball game. How would you handle it?",
    "(I really should have prepared some questions for this interview... Uh...)",
    "What would you rather fight: one hundred imp-sized unicorns or one unicorn-sized imp?",
    "I wasn't expecting such a detailed answer. It seems you're quite the tactician.",

    "...You are relieved of your captainly duties and may reside at the fort as our welcome guest.",
    "Thank you for your service. No need for a speech.",

    "You really do have your heart set on that beer garden, don't you, Bill?",
    "Maybe it's time for...",
    "An...Inn-tervention.",
    "That's why we need to 'bolt' on a fletching extension, Bill.",
    "The Raptor and I are going on an adventure, and we need to ensure the fort is well-defended in my absence.",
    "It's incredible how fast you work, Bill.Thanks again!",
    "We're going to build out the extension to the guardhouse to help supply ammo. As captain of the guardhouse, you'll have to manage this area too.",
    "Sure!",
    "I need to see if my new hire is happy with the ranger's workroom.",
    "Hello! I see you've already found yourself right at home here.",
    "The Raptor and I need to head to the crypt north of here. Just checking you have everything you need before we go?",
    "Brilliant. I feel a lot better knowing the fort is in capable hands. I'd better go and see if the Raptor is ready to investigate the crypt.",
    "The Raptor recommended I meet up with him.",
    "Zemouregal failed to open this door with brute force. Maybe there's a more thoughtful solution around here he missed.",
    "Something tells me it's going to take both of us to solve this.",
    "I need to investigate this door with the Raptor.",
    "I should show this to the Raptor.",
    "What do you make of this, Raptor?",
    "We should research this device. Magical artefacts can be dangerous.",
    "The Raptor said I should show this to Reldo in the library of Varrock palace.",
    "I need to learn more of this dragonkin device from Reldo in the Varrock Palace library.",
    "It's not what I expected. There's a surprising amount of busywork.",
    "We found this artefact sealed in a dragonkin door north of Fort Forinthry. Can you identify it?",
    "What happened to the Raptor?Is he dead?",
    "For how long?",
    "That's a little inconvenient. We're on an adventure together. I'll have to get him out.",
    "How do I get a potion of dreamless sleep?",
    "That's certainly very convenient.",
    "I've lost my potion. May I have another?",
    "I'd rather not get trapped in a nightmare prison. I need to drink a potion of dreamless sleep before I enter the Raptor's dream.",
    "Should?",
    "I need to use this close to the Raptor so I can enter his dream.",
    "Are you alright?",
    "You fell into a dream state after you touched the device from the door.",
    "Reldo did try to warn you but--",
    "I'm very real. Reldo gave me a potion to help me enter your mind.",
    "Entering a dream within a dream? That's a little much for me. I'll stay where I am.",
    "What are they to you? It's your dream. Perhaps a metaphor for something?",
    "Can't you just give it a little love tap?",
    "Who are they?",
    "Who are those people?",
    "It's your dream. They'll be manifestations of your subconsciousness. Surely you know them?",
    "The Raptor? Caring about people?",
    "What is it?",
    "Hey.Are you alright?",
    "Why not?",
    "How do you know that?Who is she?",
    "Your parents!",
    "You're the Raptor?",
    "Why?",
    "With whom?",
    "Then why did you marry the king?",
    "Couldn't you have been a sort of warrior queen?",
    "So you started wearing a disguise?",
    "And being rude to people? Is that an act too?",
    "Your garden of tranquillity in Varrock palace? I think I understand.",
    "The king's position seems secure these days. Maybe there's room to re-negotiate your compromise.",
    "How do we get out of here, then?",
    "Earlier, it was like you were dreaming. You weren't entirely lucid.",
    "Where are we now?This place is creepy.",
    "Let's find out.",
    "What's Roald doing here?",
    "Let's follow that light. I think it's leading us somewhere.",
    "Bianca Dunnett. Aster's sister, who murdered the Duke of Edgeville. What is she doing here?",
    "The dream...it's changing!Something new has appeared.",
    "I suppose we'll never know for certain.",
    "No! I remember. The writings on the wall. The dream journal. I learned the incantation that'll breach the seal on the dragonkin door. We have to get back to the crypt!",
    "I should talk to Ellamaria.",
    "You shake the ball, expecting something to happen...but nothing does.",
    "Oh no! The crypt guards. They're both dead!",
    "Zemouregal.Who else could it be?",
    "Where is this?",
    "Draekeun. Vorkath. Skek Pthen.",
    "That's a big dragon.",
    "We've fought bigger, yes. But let's not forget that one was chained up underground. This one looks pretty free to roam.",
    "It doesn't look like a dragon I've ever seen before. I imagine, based on the age of this tomb, that this dragon could have been killed by now, or at least died of old age.",
    "Sounds like a plausible plan, but he could raise any dragon. What would be so special about this one?",
    "Over here! Look at this. Are you seeing what I'm seeing?",
    "It's clearly a table, but that isn't what I am pointing out.",
    "The dust has been disturbed.",
    "It looks to have been broken recently too.",
    "That's part of a map! There must have been an entire map here. Zemouregal has taken it.",
    "Help me look around. Let's see if we can wrest all the pieces from their grabby rotten hands before they finish collapsing this tomb.",
    "After all we've been through together? What if I get mauled by zombies?",
    "Looks like the table is missing some pieces. I wonder if they're around here somewhere.",
    "There we go. That seems to be all of them. I can't quite make out what it's a map of as it's all jumbled up.",
    "I reckon I can figure this out by moving the pieces around.",
    "How much?",
    "...Really?",
    "That looks complete.",
    "Should see what the Raptor thinks of this.",
    "The map appears to represent the Lunar Sea.",
    "But look! I don't recognise that island there.",
    "I've got one right here.",
    "It just isn't there. How could an island be missed off map records?",
    "The two murals in this room. You don't suppose that one there is the island and the other is perhaps the inhabitant of this island?",
    "That sounds like a good plan. Let's get out of here. I'll see you back at the fort.",
    "Yes?",
    "It's our secret.",
    "Overseer Siv back in Fort Forinthry will be able to help us further. I've traced a map of the new island and where it sits. Hopefully she'll be able to help us.",
    "Siv, the Raptor and I discovered an ancient map in the crypt north of here! I think it's a very old representation of the Lunar Sea, but we don't recognise one of the islands on the map.",
    "That can wait. Here, I sketched the shape of the islands.",
    "And the mysterious island?",
    "I don't believe that's a rumour. There are two murals in the room that sit either side of this stone map. One depicts a dragon, the other an island.",
    "Zemouregal seems to have taken an interest in Ungael. We interrupted his undead who had dismantled the map and attempting[sic] to collapse the crypt. No doubt he commanded them to cover his tracks.",
    "Alright. I'll report back to the Raptor. He'll have made it back to the guardhouse by now.",
    "She confirmed our mystery island does exist. The Fremennik people know of it, but steer well clear of it.",
    "They call it 'Ungael' and it's guarded by a dragon.",
    "Siv is looking to charter a ship to explore the island. Time is of the essence; it's clear Zemouregal desires something on Ungael."

    "...but studying such a device caused the observer to fall into a deep sleep and have vivid dreams.",
    "You could think of it as a 'dream journal' of sorts - this device both inspired and recorded the dreams of its owner.",
    "...Certainly.You need only gaze meditatively into one of the facets until you feel sleepy.",
    "Oh, dear! It appears the device is trapped. The dragonkin guard their secrets so jealously. If only your companion hadn't been in such a hurry, I could have warned him.",
    "No, he's imprisoned in a mental maze constructed from his worst nightmares!",
    "Forever-ish.",
    "Hang on. You'll need to drink a potion of dreamless sleep before you use the device. Wouldn't do for you to get trapped in nightmares of your own.",
    "By a startling coincidence, I happen to have one to hand.",
    "Isn't it just? A renowned enchanter, with a brilliant mind and spectacular good looks, brewed up a batch for me. It's done wonders for my insomnia.",
    "Well, I would give you a potion of dreamless sleep, but your backpack is full.",
    "Well, I would give you a potion of dreamless sleep, but your backpack is full.",
    "Now go on and drink that potion. It's quite safe.",
    "The potion you drank will suppress your dreams. Activate the dragonkin device, and it should bring you into the Raptor's dream.",
    "Should. Best be quick. If the potion wears off, you may be trapped forever in a cage of your own nightmares.",
    "I have an errand to run, so can't stay to keep an eye on you, but I'll close the library so you can have some privacy. Pleasant dreams!"
