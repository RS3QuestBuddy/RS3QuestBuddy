    "Nothing like that. In fact, definitely not that. Menaphos opened its gates to Al Kharid. They want to set up new trade to help cement the peace. The Emir sent me to keep Hassan safe and assist wherever I could. He made a point that I wasn't to spy and risk this deal. Osman didn't suggest anything different. All he wanted was information on the lineage of the old pharaohs. I've found most of it, but there appears to be missing information. It appears that information about Senliten and Osmumten has been removed. I was hoping you might be able to fill in the gaps.",
    "I'm sorry, I think I'm missing something. Why would this be a problem? He's just asked for some public records.",

    "Until Amascut is dealt with fully, anything could happen.",
    "Enjoying being back in the library?",
    "Yes, all done, although things didn't go exactly as planned.",

You Kharidians could learn a thing or two about virtue. Maybe that could be the reason why your abhorrent hovel pales in comparison to the city of gleaming gold! Besides, I AM loyal to the only TRUE ruler of this desert. Some shared blood and dusty scrolls couldn't matter less to me, 'spymaster'. The bloodline of Senliten fell long ago, and the gods shall not be far behind them. As for my relations with the Pharaoh, don't pretend you don't have a similar situation with your Emir.

I am elevated above all simple strife and people's petty problems. Every man in this world envies me. EVERY MAN IN THIS WORLD ENVIES ME! I have been plucked from my mortal coil by the gods themselves, this realm is just an unfulfilling limbo to an eternity most high. The unyielding affection from my supplicants is the only thing I demand, and in return I do so much for them. But it seems even that which should have come naturally is beyond their seal-limbed grasp. My ascent to godhood is inevitable, this throne just a stepping-stone to even greater power, wherein my words will shake the very sand we stand upon.

    "More tellingly, protected are those who also share my bloodline...and those that show them the proper respect.",
    "Ah, a fair guess, I'll grant you. His right of rule is only given by men. The first of the Menaphite pharaohs was chosen by Tumeken himself. By Leela's account, Emir Ali is a good man. But no, it is Osman and Leela that are of my bloodline.",
    "Good! You have been paying attention.",
    "Leela has spoken highly of this Ozan character. But no, it is Osman and Leela that are of my bloodline.",
    "Osman and Leela are my descendants, and therefore are the rightful rulers of Menaphos, the chosen of Tumeken.",
    "It is not. This is one of the ancient wrongs that should be righted. The line of kings should be restored, and Osman is next in line.",
    "He is also going about it the wrong way.",
    "Let me tell you another story so you might understand, this time from after my death. When I passed, my son, Osmumten, became Pharaoh. He inherited a kingdom at war with the ancient enemy. He would often visit me here in my tomb for counsel. One time, Tumeken himself bid my son here to seek me out; this was the day that Tumeken laid down his own life to spare his people, thus bringing an end to war. Osmumten was left to rule alone, and rebuild. It was he who decreed the creation of both Menaphos and Sophanem as you know them today. To build a city where only tents had stood, as a bastion against our lands that were rapidly turning into desert. He toiled day and night, yet did not order others to follow his example, but follow him they did. His fortitude and will inspired his people to survive in the wake of our god's passing. His strength inspired them, a strength that persisted throughout his rule.",
    "Others of our people did not respond so well to the loss of Tumeken. They blamed him for turning our lands into a desert. They did not recognize it as the cost of survival, for without his sacrifice, we would have lost everything regardless. They stopped worshipping him, questioned his past decisions and began to question his authority. Their minds became infected with doubt and contempt. Ultimately, they began to question my son's right to rule, for he was one Chosen of Tumeken, and now the only physical embodiment of his rule. The might of Menaphos was loyal to him, however, so they dared not challenge him openly. They plotted in the dark, conspired against him, using trickery and subterfuge to wear down his resolve. Eventually, they struck - an assassin that had worked up through the ranks of his royal guard. At least his death was swift... He was supplanted, the royal bloodline was deposed, and Menaphos has been ruled over by the descendants of that usurper ever since.",
    "My son did not get the respect in death that I did. Indeed, I fully suspect his usurper was behind the desecration of my tomb. The chosen of Tumeken were strong of will, yet those that had replaced it were weak of mind. They ruled as they plotted, not from the front, but from the shadows. They subjugated the weak, taxed the rich, divided the people by class. Their minds poisoned the minds of all they ruled. Much of this I have only learned since my restoration. It is a wonder that Menaphos stands still to this day, with rulers such as it has had.",
    "That there is more to the strength of man and woman than is seen in the throes of war. That strength is not simply physical might, but also strength of will and character. And that deception and plotting are not traits that should be sought in a leader. Those are the traits of our enemy, yet these are the methods Osman employs in his bid for power. Even if he succeeds in his goal, I fear for what that means for his rule. He is of the line of kings and, as such, he should act like one and lead by example. You must investigate why the people of the desert have become so weak of mind and will.",
    "No. By now you have either learned of our ways or you do not wish to. It matters not which. What you need to know, however, is something that Osman does not. Three things, in fact. One, that Leela and I fully suspect now that Amascut was behind my son's downfall, as a means of corrupting the god Het - he being our pantheon's god of strength. Two, that I fear Osman himself is an extension of this plot. He is walking a dangerous path alone, and he must stop before it is too late. And finally, only once he has acknowledged these two points, that I can tell him what he needs to make his claim. That being the name of my grandchild, who was smuggled out to safety as my son died - the ancestor whom he can draw back to such that he might prove his royalty.",

If he were able to connect us with Senliten through official records, he could challenge the current Pharaoh's rule. He is building towards a coup, and has you caught right in the middle of it...though he would not risk raising suspicions in Menaphos if he did not already have something.",

    "I can not believe what I am hearing, Osman. You are supposed to be loyal to this emirate, not your own selfish desires.",
    "Yet to achieve this aim, you have betrayed this city! You have betrayed both me and my father. You speak of trust, but you have betrayed that too. Even if you were to remove all obstacles and become Pharaoh, how am I ever to trust you again? Would you send your spies into my midst?",
    "Except that you didn't! My father died as a result. He would be ashamed of your actions. The ends do not justify the means.",
    "I have no doubt, but so shall you. His blood is on your hands as much as on Jabari's. You are a traitor to the oaths you swore to him and me.",
    "It is taking all of my will right now to not have you executed where you stand, rightful Pharaoh or not...but I listened well to my father's words. You shall not die for these actions.",
    "You misunderstand me, Osman. Your treasonous acts shall not go unpunished. You are hereby stripped of the rank of spymaster and exiled from Al Kharid forthwith.",
    "NO! I shall not hear it! Get out of my sight and this city. Should you ever set foot in Al Kharid again, your life will be forfeit.",
    "Welcome! It is good to see you again. How can I be of service, friend of Al Kharid?",
    "Now that ugly business has been taken care of, what news have you of Jabari?",
    "Be quiet, Khoochak.",
    "Het? He was always a protector of Al Kharid, but his presence has not been felt for many years. I was still young at the time, but now I think of it, he seemed to disappear not long before the war between Menaphos and Al Kharid began. Our troops took it as an ill omen, and though the war itself was more than just a series of stalemates, it did mark the decline of my father's rule.",
    "Het's disappearance, my kidnapping, my father's death, Osman's corruption. This all leads back to that diamond, I have no doubt. Still, if Het showed himself to you, then perhaps things are not completely lost."
